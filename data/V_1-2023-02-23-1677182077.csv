Por ello, estamos ampliando nuestro equipo con un programador Front-end para el desarrollo de nuevas funcionalidades para nuestra plataforma. üíªü§ôüèª

Qu√© ofrecemos:
Una oportunidad de escapar de los desarrollos monol√≠ticos. Cada mes lanzamos una funcionalidad nueva, dando pie a progresar con tus conocimientos de desarrollo, y evitar la monoton√≠a de hacer las mismas tareas una y otra vez.
Una organizaci√≥n horizontal donde se tienen en cuenta las diversas opiniones e ideas a la hora de tomar decisiones.
Un entorno de trabajo distendido al m√°ximo. Nos consideramos una familia, y basamos nuestra cultura en la confianza y la cercan√≠a üòä.
El mejor sitio para crecer. Avanzamos r√°pido, experimentando y aprendiendo juntos.
Horario flexible elegido por la persona. Trabajo por sprints, basado en metodolog√≠a Scrum.
Salario: 23-27k‚Ç¨ anuales.

Qu√© puedes esperar de tus primeros meses en Planet:
El primer mes te pondr√°s a punto para poder desarrollar: aprender√°s a usar nuestra plataforma y conocer√°s sus puntos fuertes y mejorables, preparar√°s tu entorno de desarrollo y aprender√°s a usar las herramientas que tenemos en Front. Podr√°s ver c√≥mo nos coordinamos e incluso haber colaborado en alguna tarea de desarrollo menor.
En el segundo mes habr√°s desplegado cambios menores en nuestro sistema de dise√±o y nuestras extensiones de Shopify con la ayuda de tu mentor.
En el tercer mes te habr√°s enfrentado a una tarea de desarrollo dentro de nuestra plataforma y para las extensiones de Shopify. Ser√° un mes donde experimentar√°s a fondo con los stacks de cada entorno.
Al cabo de seis meses esperamos que ya sepas qu√© se puede y no se puede hacer con la API de Shopify, que participes en el dise√±o de nuevos addons y que puedas afrontar nuevos desarrollos en la plataforma (siempre con la ayuda de tus compa√±eros :)).
El objetivo final es que con el tiempo lideres el desarrollos de addons para la secci√≥n de automatizaciones, proponiendo soluciones que se adapten a los requisitos y limitaciones de Shopify.

Requisitos t√©cnicos:
Conocimientos demostrables en el desarrollo con Angular o dos a√±os de experiencia laboral en desarrollo web.
El prototipado se desarrolla en Figma y se maqueta en HTML5 y SCSS. Disponemos de una l√≠nea de dise√±o para simplificar este proceso.
Conocimientos b√°sicos de patrones de dise√±o e inter√©s por desarrollar c√≥digo que sea f√°cil de mantener.
La mayor parte de los desarrollos parten de cero, por lo que priman las buenas pr√°cticas. Esto permite ir actualizando las versiones sobre una base s√≥lida y robusta para todo el equipo.
Experiencia con Git.
Conocimientos b√°sicos de MongoDB.
MongoDB es nuestro motor de BBDD principal por lo que cualquier funcionalidad que desarrolles pasar√° por comunicarte con ella.
Para pruebas, debbuging e incidencias ser√° necesario consultar directamente a la base de datos, por lo que, si tienes experiencia previa te resultar√° de gran ayuda.
No es necesario conocer todas las tecnolog√≠as de nuestro stack, pero s√≠ especial inter√©s por aprender y trabajar con ellas. En el d√≠a a d√≠a, desarrollar√°s en Angular@14, pero entrar√°s en contacto con nuestra infraestructura de AWS, sistema de logs y dem√°s tecnolog√≠as.

Tambi√©n, es deseable:
Nos gustan las personas resolutivas, que no tengan miedo a enfrentarse a nuevas situaciones y a trabajar desde la terminal.
El inter√©s por explorar todos los campos y tecnolog√≠as es algo esencial; siempre estamos buscando c√≥mo optimizar nuestros procesos, aunque implique integrarnos con otras plataformas o usar otras librer√≠as.
El ingl√©s es algo esencial. Desarrollar√°s funcionalidad para una plataforma que se usa por todo el mundo; por lo que ayudar en la internacionalizaci√≥n de los textos y tener en cuenta el formateo de n√∫meros y moneda es parte del d√≠a a d√≠a."

You love technology and working with brilliant people
You have a Bachelor's or equivalent in Computer Science, STEM or similar degree
You are experienced with Linux systems administration, package management, and operations
You have hands-on experience with at least one public cloud
You are familiar with Docker and Kubernetes
You are an excellent Python programmer and enjoy challenging projects
You understand the importance of reliable software and strive to design and code to that expectation
You are organized and want your team to deliver timely, high quality software

About Canonical

Canonical is a growing international software company that works with the open-source community to deliver Ubuntu, ""the world's best free software platform"". Our mission is to realise the potential of free software in the lives of individuals and organisations. Our services are helping individuals and businesses worldwide to reduce costs, improve efficiency and enhance security with Ubuntu.

Status is building the tools and infrastructure for the advancement of a secure, private, and open web3.

With the high level goals of preserving the right to privacy, mitigating the risk of censorship, and promoting economic trade in a transparent, open manner, Status is building a community where anyone is welcome to join and contribute.

As an organization, Status seeks to push the web3 ecosystem forward through research, creation of developer tools, and support of the open source community.

As a product, Status is an open source, Ethereum-based app that gives users the power to chat, transact, and access a revolutionary world of DApps on the decentralized web. But Status is also building foundational infrastructure for the whole Ethereum ecosystem, including the Nimbus ETH 1.0 and 2.0 clients, the Keycard hardware wallet, and the Waku messaging protocol (a continuation of Whisper).

As a team, Status has been completely distributed since inception. Our team is currently 150+ core contributors strong, and welcomes a growing number of community members from all walks of life, scattered all around the globe.

We care deeply about open source, and our organizational structure has minimal hierarchy and no fixed work hours. We believe in working with a high degree of autonomy while supporting the organization's priorities.

Nwaku

We are building Waku as a public good infrastructure. Waku is the messaging layer of Web3.

It is a decentralized, censorship-resistant, privacy-preserving communication network that enables anyone to send and receive messages without worrying about surveillance or de-platforming.

We are developing 3 open source implementations of Waku: nwaku, go-waku and js-waku.

Nwaku is the reference implementation of Waku, in which protocols are first implemented. Nwaku is used as a service node to operate the Waku Relay network, the backbone of the Waku network.

Our main repo is https://github.com/waku-org/nwaku/.

We are looking for software engineers that are passionate about Ethereum, decentralization and software excellence, and who would relish the opportunity to create a first-class decentralized messaging network and bring these new capabilities to the Web3 ecosystem!

Key Responsibilities

You ideally will have
A passion for blockchain technology, privacy-preserving technology and decentralization.
At least 4 years of software engineering experience.
Experience with low-level/strongly typed languages (C/C++/Go/Rust or Java/C#).
Embedded systems development experience.
Experience building networking-heavy applications and p2p networking specifically.
Familiarity with message propagation in loosely connected networks.
Familiar with p2p building blocks such as gossiping, routing and discovery (DHTs), and Nat traversal.

Bonus points if you have

Overstory's mission is to help solve our climate crisis by providing real-time intelligence about the planet's vegetation. In our first step toward this mission, we are applying machine learning to satellite imagery to track forests and vegetation, helping to reduce the risk of wildfires and power outages.

We have already proven our business model and we're all united behind our ambitious vision to scale up this model to help humanity and the planet. We recently raised a round of funding, led by Convective Capital. Other investors include: B Capital Group, Moxxie Ventures, Capital T, Pale Blue Dot and many other climate-focussed investors.

If you want to have a real impact and solve some of the world's most complex challenges with advanced technology, come work with our talented and passionate team. Overstory is based in Amsterdam but we are a remote-first company, with people living all over the U.S. and Europe.

About The Role

We are looking for a Principal Data Scientist who is a creative, but pragmatic, problem-solver. Reporting into VP Engineering you will be the most senior Data Scientist on the team. You'll spend most of your time working autonomously or within a small team, building, improving, and running our models. You will work closely with the CTO setting, planning, and executing the long-term vision for our ML platform.

This is a hands-on role that will involve exploring satellite imagery sets and other geographical datasets; using machine learning to analyze the images; and working with the teams to deliver the results to our customers. We have models and pipelines at various stages of maturity and we would expect you to use and apply the results of the stable ones and help us improve and validate the ones still in early development. You will work with the team to implement new ML techniques, models, and algorithms that bring step changes to our analyses.

Big part of the role is using the outputs of our analyses to solve customer needs. You will work closely with our Customer Success team to understand the customers' problems and then work with other Data Scientists and the rest of the tech team to come up with solutions to those problems. You will help us adapt our models to different customer needs, but also environmental and vegetative factors.

On a typical day you could be: running inference on satellite imagery, checking the quality of the output, tweaking the input parameters, and retraining the model with new labels; writing Python code to process and analyze GIS data; researching and incorporating new datasets into your project and sharing findings with the team; reading about the latest Deep Learning techniques and applying them to our datasets.

You will have responsibility for your own projects, and we'll expect you to take initiative to help us improve overall. Whether the work is about forest damage detection, tree species identification or biodiversity monitoring, you are up for the challenge!

About You
You are creative and curious.
You are pragmatic, you know when a simple solution is sufficient or when new model development is required.
You are a strong communicator, able to express your ideas succinctly. You make complex ideas accessible to others.
You have an eye for quality, your work is thorough, and you pay attention to both the small details and the larger picture.
Teamwork is at your core, and you like to help others grow and succeed.

Requirements
You have at least 8 years of commercial experience as a Data Scientist or Machine Learning Engineer.
You have spent at least 3 years working in a startup environment (preferably early stage).
You have advanced Python experience (including PyTorch and/or Tensorflow).
Experience working with GIS systems and processing GIS data.
Experience processing satellite data and/or imagery.

What You Get
To be part of truly mission-driven work that reduces wildfires, protects earth's natural resources and helps solve our climate crisis.
Flexible working environment with a lot of autonomy. We build our work days around our lives, not the other way around.
Other benefits like a remote working budget, an educational budget and time to develop new skills.
To be surrounded by an excellent, vibrant, smart team who have each other's back and believe in a culture of openness, tolerance and respect.
Equity and a competitive salary.

About Our Team

We are a group of 33 people from all over the world. Eleven nationalities are represented in our team. We work remotely from seven different countries and occasionally (optionally!) meet up for in-person collaboration.

Diversity & Inclusion

We place enormous value on diversity and inclusion with regards to gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation, religion, age, education, disability, disciplines and skillsets. We believe that the best ideas emerge when people with different perspectives and approaches work together on a problem.

We're always looking to diversify our team further, but we're proud of the fact that four out of the eight people on our leadership team are female or non-white males, 40% of the overall team identifies as female and 25% of the team are people of color.

To achieve that we are building a new community around Python opscode for open source applications, running on Kubernetes. We want to move all of Canonical and Ubuntu IS onto this new, open source codebase.

We are confident that we can dramatically improve the experience of running complex business operations - and then we can help our customers embrace those new techniques and products.

It is a role that requires rigour in both code and customer interactions. Our engineers are technically astute open source enthusiasts who are excited about cloud computing and are ready to join a global team charged with delivering world class services to our customers.

Strong Python development skills and familiarity with Kubernetes are key requirements of this role. You'll work closely with other teams in Canonical to ensure your products operate reliably, efficiently and scale to production sized workloads for our customers looking to adopt cutting-edge technology. You will participate and be responsible for ensuring sound software architecture and follow best practices in software quality, testing and documentation.

What you'll do
Work in Python to design and deliver open source software operations code
Work across the entire Linux stack, from kernel, networking, storage, to applications
Learn to think rigorously about application and infrastructure reliability
Shape high quality open source monitoring and alerting infrastructure
Simplify open source operations for our customers and open source community
Demonstrate sound engineering design and testing principles in your code
Follow agile software development practices

Grow a healthy, collaborative engineering culture in line with company values
Work from home with global travel once or twice a year for up to 2 weeks for events

Who you are
You love technology and working with brilliant people
You have a Bachelor's or equivalent in Computer Science, STEM or similar degree
You are experienced with Linux systems administration, package management, and operations
You have hands-on experience with at least one public cloud
You are familiar with Docker and Kubernetes
You are an excellent Python programmer and enjoy challenging projects
You understand the importance of reliable software and strive to design and code to that expectation

The role involves the development and maintenance of Canonical's open source certification tools, supporting the creation of hardware solutions for test automation, and automating our existing processes. We seek out continuous process and tooling improvements as part of expanding the certification test suites, ultimately to improve the quality of Linux experience felt by millions of Linux end users.

Key responsibilities
Maintain and develop new features to our Python based test automation tools like Checkbox, used by both in-house teams and industry partners.
Invent new ways to enable remote, automated testing.
Help build the software counterpart to in-house designed testing hardware to help test device enablement (graphics, hotplug, bluetooth, etc).
Write functional and performance tests to support hardware enablement and to protect from regressions.
Participate in meetings involving international travel 2-3 times per year.

Required Skills And Experience
Knowledge of Python programming language.
Quality oriented, pragmatic approach to software design and implementation.
Interest in test automation methodologies.
Previous experience working with Ubuntu or other Linux distributions.

Status is building the tools and infrastructure for the advancement of a secure, private, and open web3.

With the high level goals of preserving the right to privacy, mitigating the risk of censorship, and promoting economic trade in a transparent, open manner, Status is building a community where anyone is welcome to join and contribute.

As an organization, Status seeks to push the web3 ecosystem forward through research, creation of developer tools, and support of the open source community.

As a product, Status is an open source, Ethereum-based app that gives users the power to chat, transact, and access a revolutionary world of DApps on the decentralized web. But Status is also building foundational infrastructure for the whole Ethereum ecosystem, including the Nimbus ETH 1.0 and 2.0 clients, the Keycard hardware wallet, and the Waku messaging protocol (a continuation of Whisper).

As a team, Status has been completely distributed since inception. Our team is currently 150+ core contributors strong, and welcomes a growing number of community members from all walks of life, scattered all around the globe.

We care deeply about open source, and our organizational structure has minimal hierarchy and no fixed work hours. We believe in working with a high degree of autonomy while supporting the organization's priorities.

Nimbus is a research team that focuses on developing an Ethereum client and library targeting both Ethereum and the upcoming, proof-of-stake-based ETH2. We believe that the largest deployment of Ethereum will potentially be on embedded systems, Nimbus will be designed to perform well on embedded, mobile, and generally resource-restricted devices. The extensible, configurable, and modular design of Nimbus will make it production ready for Web 3.0 and will ensure that it can be supported and maintained across all goals of Ethereum 2.0.

Building the stack from the ground up, we're translating the latest Ethereum 2.0 research into practical, performant and reusable libraries to provide fertile exploration ground for further R&D. Check our latest update!

Improving the observability of the Nimbus software by implementing additional metrics and tuning the logging output
Detailed reporting of all encountered issues to the Nimbus development team

You ideally will have
Experience or interest in Ethereum and/or the ecosystem
Openness to learning & using new programming languages, e.g. Nim

Experience in, and passion for, blockchain technology.
A strong alignment to our principles: https://status.im/about/#our-principles

Bonus points if

Experience with running ETH2.0 validator and beacon chain nodes (Lighthouse, Prysm, Teku, etc)
Deep understanding and expertise on the technical level of the ETH2 protocol (such as validation, slashing, network edge cases)

We are confident that we can dramatically improve the experience of running complex business operations - and then we can help our customers embrace those new techniques and products. Traditionally, IS is an inward-facing operation. We would like to transform our IS team into an extension of the product engineering capability at Canonical.

It is a role that requires rigour in both code and customer interactions. Our engineers are technically astute open source enthusiasts who are excited about cloud computing and are ready to join a global team charged with delivering world class services to our customers.

Strong Python development skills and familiarity with Kubernetes are key requirements of this role. You'll work closely with other teams in Canonical to ensure your products operate reliably, efficiently and scale to production sized workloads for our customers looking to adopt cutting-edge technology. You will participate and be responsible for ensuring sound software architecture and follow best practices in software quality, testing and documentation.

Shape high quality open source monitoring and alerting infrastructure
Simplify open source operations for our customers and open source community

Follow agile software development practices

You are experienced with Linux systems administration, package management, and operations
You have hands-on experience with at least one public cloud
You are familiar with Docker and Kubernetes
You are an excellent Python programmer and enjoy challenging projects
You understand the importance of reliable software and strive to design and code to that expectation
You are organized and want your team to deliver timely, high quality software
