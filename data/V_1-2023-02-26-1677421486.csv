Growing together. You’ll review others' work and happily seek feedback on yours to ensure we build a better codebase and sharpen each other's skills.




What we’re looking for from you
Solid experience in either a DevOps or Engineer role with a keen interest in solving problems using code.
Understanding of CI/CD and DevOps methodologies. You understand the build and deployment cycle of an application and how it fits into a global platform.

Our customers are at the forefront of some of the most interesting data in the world, using SingleStore to push the boundaries every day. To do this well, they leverage the expertise of our Support Engineering Team, composed of technical subject matter experts on the frontlines of critical customer issues.

This Support Engineering role skews far more towards engineering than typical technical support as you will need to delve into database internals and memory allocators, diagnose complex SQL query behavior, and investigate Linux and Kubernetes related configurations, all in the name of resolving complex product issues. Our Support Engineers are constantly learning a wide range of customer systems and technical concepts and are thrilled by the new and exciting challenges that they encounter each day.

To accurately identify the source and solution of an issue, this team will take the time to learn about the customer’s business and systems while helping to improve their fundamental SingleStore and database operational knowledge. This often requires additional research and time spent on learning new technologies and tools outside of just the database engine while also being deeply engaged with multiple departments including development teams, query performance engineering, product management, infrastructure SREs, etc.

Role And Responsibilities

Provide product support to our on-premise and cloud hosted enterprise customers, acting as the first-line-of-defense for complex technical issues, bug diagnosis, or resolving critical outages.
Identify and reproduce product issues and submit formal bug reports or feature requests to the appropriate Engineering team.
Understand and help to improve complex SQL behavior to diagnose bugs or improve performance.
Collaborate with software developers, sales engineers, and technical account managers to keep all teams up to date with current issues a customer may be facing.
Work to streamline and improve various Support and Engineering processes and tools, author new knowledge base articles and run-books, and help the team continually improve efficiency and effectiveness.
Participate in our on-call rotation that may include weekends and holidays.

Required Skills And Experience

4+ years of previous customer-facing advanced technical support experience.
Previous experience as a DBA or Support Engineer at a database company.
Experience with SQL databases and advanced SQL query optimization and tuning. You should be familiar enough with at least one commercial or open source database to decipher its EXPLAIN plan and understand potential performance impact or ways to improve the query.
Strong background in general product troubleshooting, keeping in mind that query processing issues can be impacted by database or linux configuration and resource availability.
A solid linux performance background. That means you are hands-on with Linux and your skills include generating and reading flame graphs, checking system resource utilization, and parsing verbose log files. Bonus points for familiarity with Kubernetes.
Experience with a scripting or coding language. Whether it’s C++, Python, Go, or Bash, you should have a go-to solution for quick problem-solving and be able to navigate through our extensive code base.
Familiarity with distributed systems and AWS/GCP. You understand how organizations deploy and maintain distributed applications and services across multiple machines and know how to analyze these systems for performance bottlenecks.
Experience improving support processes regarding ticket triage, escalation, and reporting business metrics back to the organization.
Strong written and verbal English communication skills. Have the ability to explain technical concepts to a wide range of end-users.

SingleStore is one platform for all data, built so you can engage with insight in every moment. Trusted by industry leaders, SingleStore enables enterprises to adapt to change as it happens, embrace diverse data with ease, and accelerate the pace of innovation. SingleStore is venture-backed and headquartered in San Francisco with offices in Portland, Seattle, Boston, Bangalore, London, Lisbon, and Kyiv. Defining the future starts with The Database of Now™.

Consistent with our commitment to diversity & inclusion, we value individuals with the ability to work on diverse teams and with a diverse range of people.

To all recruitment agencies: SingleStore does not accept agency resumes. Please do not forward resumes to SingleStore employees. SingleStore is not responsible for any fees related to unsolicited resumes and will not pay fees to any third-party agency or company that does not have a signed agreement with the Company.

Now, more than 1,000+ employees work across the globe in our offices and remotely. Backed by a renowned set of investors and partners including CapitalG, Tiger Global, and ICONIQ Growth, we’ve set out to build the future of AI.

Data visualization is often the most striking (and for some, the most accessible) part of the data-to-insights process. Let’s face it — there’s nothing more exciting than beautiful fit-for-purpose data viz.

We are looking for a talented software engineer to create usable, intuitive, beautiful interfaces and scalable engines for Dataiku DSS. Dataiku DSS brings together big data and AI technologies into a unique and easy-to-use platform. It allows data scientists to process data with SQL databases, Spark, and Kubernetes with either user-friendly interfaces or code. The same platform also allows business analysts to create powerful machines or deep learning models with just a few clicks.

What We Do

We design and code experiences that resonate with our growing customer base. We empower non-technical users with user-friendly and well-thought tools to let them quickly and efficiently visualize, analyze, or process their data. Our current technical stack is based on Javascript, AngularJS, Angular, and D3.js on the frontend (we only support the latest versions of Chrome and Firefox!). We develop using Java, Spring, and Python on the backend.

What You Will Do

With your top-tier teammates from the engineering team and the help of the UX team, you will:

Build the components that allow Dataiku DSS users to create and display charts, dashboards, and ad-hoc web applications in a scalable way (both frontend and backend).
Prototype and create new ways to interact with data or integrations with other products such as Tableau, PowerBI, Salesforce, Slack, etc.
Work closely with product managers and UX designers to brainstorm on new features and iteratively refine solutions.
Shape a safe place to work where all ideas and suggestions are welcome and taken into account, and where we all know everyone does their best.
Write high-quality code, as your teammates do!
You are the ideal recruit if:

You have experience in software development and you are interested in data visualization tools.
You are customer-oriented — you want to understand customer needs and how the product is used.
You are at ease with both frontend and backend development, or you’ve mastered frontend development but are not afraid to dive into backend code to better understand how it works.
You know that a chart is worth a thousand grid cells.
You have firsthand experience (either professional or personal) building a real product.
You blink each time you see a misaligned pixel!
You are humble and kind. You don't hesitate to ask questions when you don't know, and you treat your colleagues with respect, kindness, and honesty.
Dataiku’s culture is right for you if:

You want to be able to define your own version of work-life balance - flexible is our go-to word, it applies equally to remote work, vacations and parental benefits
You need autonomy to thrive - we trust our people, give them space to do their best and stay away from artificial deadlines
You enjoy spending time with your colleagues and learning from your peers - meet for Friday universities, annual offsites, virtual trivia nights and more
You like feeling cared about - watch out for the magical Christmas box delivered at home and an unforgettable onboarding week
You care about giving back - it’s what our Ikig.AI program is all about: Dataikers are encouraged to work pro bono for one or several nonprofits of their choosing

Some of the traits we expect from you:
No challenge is too big or too small for you. You get excited at the prospect of a complex project and at the same time you understand that small improvements can sometimes make a massive difference.
You hold yourself and your team to a high standard when working in production.
You have some cloud experience, ideally with AWS.
You have experience with at least 2 different DB technologies as well as awesome SQL skills and ideally NoSQL as well. We use Dremio, Vertica, Mongo as well as other technologies. But we won’t frown upon you if Oracle is your cup of tea.

Soy Víctor, cofundador de Planet 🌍, la única plataforma de automatización y gestión de precios para Shopify en español. Actualmente contamos con más de 500 clientes, con presencia en ¡+65 países diferentes!

Por ello, estamos ampliando nuestro equipo con un programador Front-end para el desarrollo de nuevas funcionalidades para nuestra plataforma. 💻🤙🏻

Qué ofrecemos:
Una oportunidad de escapar de los desarrollos monolíticos. Cada mes lanzamos una funcionalidad nueva, dando pie a progresar con tus conocimientos de desarrollo, y evitar la monotonía de hacer las mismas tareas una y otra vez.
Una organización horizontal donde se tienen en cuenta las diversas opiniones e ideas a la hora de tomar decisiones.
Un entorno de trabajo distendido al máximo. Nos consideramos una familia, y basamos nuestra cultura en la confianza y la cercanía 😊.
El mejor sitio para crecer. Avanzamos rápido, experimentando y aprendiendo juntos.
Horario flexible elegido por la persona. Trabajo por sprints, basado en metodología Scrum.
Salario: 23-27k€ anuales.

Qué puedes esperar de tus primeros meses en Planet:
El primer mes te pondrás a punto para poder desarrollar: aprenderás a usar nuestra plataforma y conocerás sus puntos fuertes y mejorables, prepararás tu entorno de desarrollo y aprenderás a usar las herramientas que tenemos en Front. Podrás ver cómo nos coordinamos e incluso haber colaborado en alguna tarea de desarrollo menor.
En el segundo mes habrás desplegado cambios menores en nuestro sistema de diseño y nuestras extensiones de Shopify con la ayuda de tu mentor.
En el tercer mes te habrás enfrentado a una tarea de desarrollo dentro de nuestra plataforma y para las extensiones de Shopify. Será un mes donde experimentarás a fondo con los stacks de cada entorno.
Al cabo de seis meses esperamos que ya sepas qué se puede y no se puede hacer con la API de Shopify, que participes en el diseño de nuevos addons y que puedas afrontar nuevos desarrollos en la plataforma (siempre con la ayuda de tus compañeros :)).
El objetivo final es que con el tiempo lideres el desarrollos de addons para la sección de automatizaciones, proponiendo soluciones que se adapten a los requisitos y limitaciones de Shopify.

Requisitos técnicos:
Conocimientos demostrables en el desarrollo con Angular o dos años de experiencia laboral en desarrollo web.
El prototipado se desarrolla en Figma y se maqueta en HTML5 y SCSS. Disponemos de una línea de diseño para simplificar este proceso.
Conocimientos básicos de patrones de diseño e interés por desarrollar código que sea fácil de mantener.
La mayor parte de los desarrollos parten de cero, por lo que priman las buenas prácticas. Esto permite ir actualizando las versiones sobre una base sólida y robusta para todo el equipo.
Experiencia con Git.
Conocimientos básicos de MongoDB.
MongoDB es nuestro motor de BBDD principal por lo que cualquier funcionalidad que desarrolles pasará por comunicarte con ella.
Para pruebas, debbuging e incidencias será necesario consultar directamente a la base de datos, por lo que, si tienes experiencia previa te resultará de gran ayuda.
No es necesario conocer todas las tecnologías de nuestro stack, pero sí especial interés por aprender y trabajar con ellas. En el día a día, desarrollarás en Angular@14, pero entrarás en contacto con nuestra infraestructura de AWS, sistema de logs y demás tecnologías.

También, es deseable:
Nos gustan las personas resolutivas, que no tengan miedo a enfrentarse a nuevas situaciones y a trabajar desde la terminal.
El interés por explorar todos los campos y tecnologías es algo esencial; siempre estamos buscando cómo optimizar nuestros procesos, aunque implique integrarnos con otras plataformas o usar otras librerías.
El inglés es algo esencial. Desarrollarás funcionalidad para una plataforma que se usa por todo el mundo; por lo que ayudar en la internacionalización de los textos y tener en cuenta el formateo de números y moneda es parte del día a día."

People deserve more from their money. More visibility, more control, more freedom. And since 2015, Revolut has been on a mission to deliver just that. With an arsenal of awesome products that span spending, saving, travel, transfers, investing, exchanging and more, our super app has helped 25+ million customers get more from their money. And we're not done yet.

As we continue our lightning-fast growth, we believe that two things are essential to continuing our success: our people and our culture.

We want brilliant people that love building great products, love redefining success, and love turning the complexity of a chaotic world into the simplicity of a beautiful solution.

About The Role

Using best practice techniques to ensure accurate and robust financial forecasts
Working closely with our accounting, data science, growth, treasury, risk, licensing and other teams to ensure consistency in our work

Improving processes to be more robust/accurate/efficient

What You'll Need
A structured and logical approach to solving problems
Post qualified experience in finance functions, preferably with experience within a financial service company within cross-functional and multi-national teams
Strong financial planning/forecasting knowledge, with proven experience in Corporate Finance/Banking/Management Consulting/Tech Startup etc.
Experience in working with high volumes of transactional data into financial analytics and/or financial reporting processes including, for example, data extraction, mapping, hierarchies. Both building or maintaining/improving data driven processes.

Good working knowledge of accounting

Nice to have
Experience in Bank modelling or Infrastructure modelling
Relevant professional qualification (CFA, ACA etc.)

Building a global financial super app isn’t enough. Our Revoluters are a priority, and that’s why in 2021 we launched our inaugural D&I Framework, designed to help us thrive and grow everyday. We're not just doing this because it's the right thing to do. We’re doing it because we know that seeking out diverse talent and creating an inclusive workplace is the way to create exceptional, innovative products and services for our customers.

About PostHog

PostHog is the open source Product OS - it's a suite of product and data tools, built on the modern data stack. We provide product analytics, session recording, feature flags, A/B testing, event pipelines and a data warehouse. PostHog can be deployed to the cloud, or self-hosted on existing infrastructure, removing the need to send user data to a 3rd party.

PostHog was created as an open source project during Y Combinator's W20 cohort and had the most successful B2B software launch on HackerNews since 2012 - with a product that was just 4 weeks old. Since then, more than 10,000 companies have installed the platform, we've had huge success with our paid upgrades, and we have raised $27m from some of the world's top investors, and have shown strong product-led growth - 97% driven by word of mouth.

Despite the 📉 tech market, we're default alive and doing better than ever!

We've been averaging >20% monthly revenue growth and we didn't raise a huge / now-overpriced round in 2021. While others are focused on layoffs and struggling to grow into huge valuations, we're focusing on an awesome product for end users, hiring (a handful of) exceptional team members and seeing fantastic increases in revenue as a result.

What You’ll Be Doing

We are looking for someone to take our analytics capabilities to the next level. You will be working with our super talented Product Analytics small team to iteratively build the next generation of our analytics backbone.

You’ll be mainly working with ClickHouse and Python, making sure all our queries are “Web Scale”, and that our users are happy. You will help us build HogQL, our own wrapper around ClickHouse SQL. More generally, you’ll proactively work to make our analytics best in class.

If you want to see for yourself exactly the kinds of projects you would be working on, check out:
Speed up property searches by 150x
Speed up trends queries by reducing data streamed between shards

About Our Engineering Teams
Engineers work across one of our small teams. Our main product-focused engineering teams are Product Analytics, Session Recording, and Experimentation. We usually hire for all three teams, and then decide where individual people will work the best. We also give people the opportunity to move across teams, to make sure they get to work on different problems and learn new skills.
We work on a two week sprint basis and we give everyone in the team the opportunity to suggest what they want to build, in order to have the biggest impact on our customers. Engineers are given real ownership of what they want to focus on, and they are responsible for tests, user feedback, and tracking.
You will be working directly with our customers - we have a weekly support hero, who is in charge of all customer questions and inquiries that week. We also have a thriving user Slack group and we receive PRs from users every week.
The technical challenge is designing a highly scalable product right out of the box when deployed on premise, supporting a wide breadth of features that give users superpowers, and enabling an ecosystem of contributors and apps from anyone in the world.

What We Value
We are open source - building a huge community around a free-for-life product is key to PostHog's strategy.
We aim to become the most transparent company, ever. In order to enable teams to make great decisions, we share as much information as we can. In our public handbook everyone can read about our roadmap, how we pay (or even let go of) people, what our strategy is, and who we have raised money from. We also have regular team-wide feedback sessions, where we share honest feedback with each other.
Working autonomously and maximizing impact - we don’t tell anyone what to do. Everyone chooses what to work on next based on what is going to have the biggest impact on our customers.
Solve big problems - we haven't built our defining feature yet. We are all about acting fast, innovating, and iterating.

Requirements
You have experience building high-performance data systems.
You’re an expert at Django, with deep SQL/database skills.
You have worked with relational databases at a large scale. Bonus points for having worked with ClickHouse or another OLAP database.
You have started a project from scratch. You might have led a project, been a founder previously, or built an impressive side project.
You have strong communication skills. We document everything, most of it publicly.
You move fast, have a strong bias for impact and you don’t shy away from stepping on toes.

Nice to have
You've worked in a high-growth SaaS company and/or analytics product.
You have extensive experience with TypeScript-based React.

If this sounds like what you’d love to be doing, we can’t wait to hear from you. If you’re not sure that you exactly fit the above criteria, get in touch anyway. Alignment with our values is just as important as experience! 🙏

Benefits

What we offer in return:
💰 Generous, transparent compensation and employee-friendly equity in PostHog
🌴 Unlimited time off with a 25 day minimum (in 2021 the team on average took 32 days off)

What you SHOULD KNOW about VaynerMedia
Think “lab” and not “agency”. We get excited about solving business problems, not creating advertising for the sake of making advertising. Our entrepreneurship DNA runs deep. We’re willing to break rules, try new things, and test hypotheses if it means better understanding our craft. It’s fun!
We believe 100% that brands can be built on digital platforms and part of our model is built bottom up, flipping the traditional advertising model and process on its head. We don’t play to agency/industry norms and our culture and energy reflects that.
Our environment (and pace) feels much more like a start-up than most agencies you might be used to. Hopefully that, and the opportunity to collaborate with the talented and enthusiastic crew, work with big brands excites you, as it does us. We can’t wait to meet you.

We value hard work, and a passion for technology, people, and our customers. Did I mention you have to be amazing?? If you haven’t got a passion for technology, people and customers it’s probably not a good idea to apply for this role as it’s not for you.
Does this sound interesting? Are you bored? We can offer a challenge! With us your contribution will matter.
Be part of our innovative growing team in the hot global market of Cybersecurity and Awareness. You can help us make our AWARD WINNING software even better and in return, we will invest in you so your skills and career path grow with our company.

Someone who can’t keep their eye on the ball, or lots of balls as the case may be
An individual that will seek constant direction or are still finding their feet in the world of product management or SaaS platforms – we need expertise.
Someone who is scared to come out of their comfort zone and try something new whilst learning along the way.

We raised our Series C funding in March 2022 for $105M at a $2.1B valuation. We continued to see exponential revenue growth last year. Join us for a whale of a ride!

About Us

Docker is a remote first company with employees across Europe and the Americas. We value transparency and asynchronous communication, but also arrange meetups and offsites to allow people to work together in person.

At Docker, we empower developers to make world-changing apps. Docker helps developers bring their ideas to reality by conquering the complexity of app development using container images. The Supply Chain team is looking to solve the following problems:
What insights can we give developers about their images and build processes?
How can developers keep their software dependencies up to date and secure?
What data can we put at developers' fingertips to supercharge their daily work?
How can developers build on expertise and pre-existing solutions within their organization?

To solve these problems, the Supply Chain team experiments on and delivers various features using data, iterating quickly on prototypes inside Docker Desktop, Docker Hub, and a new cross-registry initiative. We’re centered around a large data plane with integrations to container registries and source control systems. We use this data to provide developers with insights and new functionality.

Who We’re Looking For

We have a variety of backend opportunities at different parts of the stack, including infrastructure and platform engineering, integrations with other web services, and customer-facing applications on both web and desktop, and we welcome applicants who are interested in any of these areas. We use various languages, but particularly Golang.

We work in a multi-cloud environment, making use of the best parts of GCP and AWS. We use a variety of databases including Datomic, Postgres and DynamoDB. Much of the backend is asynchronous and queues are center stage in our architecture. We use Kubernetes to run our services, and serverless technology where appropriate. Our services build automatically and are deployed into production with a click of a button. We believe in making small changes and deploying regularly.

The ideal candidate will have a strong desire to investigate and learn new technologies. In return, we offer you the unique opportunity to build world-class tools to help millions of developers like you.

Qualifications
3+ years experience in backend engineering.
Proficiency in modern programming languages.

We raised our Series C funding in March 2022 for $105M at a $2.1B valuation. We continued to see exponential revenue growth last year. Join us for a whale of a ride!

About Us

Docker is a remote first company with employees across Europe and the Americas. We value transparency and asynchronous communication, but also arrange meetups and offsites to allow people to work together in person.

At Docker, we empower developers to make world-changing apps. Docker helps developers bring their ideas to reality by conquering the complexity of app development using container images. The Supply Chain team is looking to solve the following problems:
What insights can we give developers about their images and build processes?
How can developers keep their software dependencies up to date and secure?
What data can we put at developers' fingertips to supercharge their daily work?
How can developers build on expertise and pre-existing solutions within their organization?

To solve these problems, the Supply Chain team experiments on and delivers various features using data, iterating quickly on prototypes inside Docker Desktop, Docker Hub, and a new cross-registry initiative. We’re centered around a large data plane with integrations to container registries and source control systems. We use this data to provide developers with insights and new functionality.

Who We’re Looking For

We have a variety of backend opportunities at different parts of the stack, including infrastructure and platform engineering, integrations with other web services, and customer-facing applications on both web and desktop, and we welcome applicants who are interested in any of these areas. We use various languages, but particularly Golang.

We work in a multi-cloud environment, making use of the best parts of GCP and AWS. We use a variety of databases including Datomic, Postgres and DynamoDB. Much of the backend is asynchronous and queues are center stage in our architecture. We use Kubernetes to run our services, and serverless technology where appropriate. Our services build automatically and are deployed into production with a click of a button. We believe in making small changes and deploying regularly.

The ideal candidate will have a strong desire to investigate and learn new technologies. In return, we offer you the unique opportunity to build world-class tools to help millions of developers like you.

Qualifications
3+ years experience in backend engineering.
Proficiency in modern programming languages.
Comfortable following software engineering best practices such as code review, source control, continuous integration, and testing.

Developers spend less time in flow, and more time waiting for builds, debugging scripts, or otherwise fighting their tools. We're here to fix that.

Our platform—which includes our open source core product—allows developer to work on distributed systems in remote, production-like dev environments while enjoying the same fast and frictionless feedback loops we've come to expect when developing a single service locally.

It's a platform that democratizes the kind of advanced developer tooling that only the largest software companies have the resources to build and maintain.

We're still a small team and you'd be joining as an individual contributor at a time where you can have a huge impact on our product and our culture. If you've ever thought to yourself that something's not right with our modern development workflows, now's your chance to help fix it!

What you'll do

As a Community Engineer, you'll empower Garden's community champions, steer the direction of our OSS product by bridging feedback to our engineering teams, and speak directly with Garden's users in service of making Garden the best user experience it can be.

More specifically you'll:
Create demo projects, tutorials, and various other creative content to ease adoption of Garden for DevOps Engineers, SREs, and developers.
Think big and create your own community initiatives to drive adoption and activate our community.
Speak directly to our engineering teams with feedback from the community, write GitHub issues, and facilitate community contributions to Garden OSS.

Who you are
You're passionate about developer productivity and removing obstacles to a smooth, easy developer experience.
You love technical writing and love helping people to understand complex technical topics in an accessible way.
Connecting with community whether on the stage or informally has been an important part of your career or you think it could be, given the opportunity.

Here's your chance to bring your passion to Garden's community and customers with examples and technical content that accelerate their delivery pipelines.

Qualifications
You have 2+ years of Kubernetes experience.
You have excellent interpersonal and written communication skills.
You're passionate about open source products and communities.
Experience writing code (in particular in Node.js/Typescript) is a big plus but not a requirement.
You're happy to work with a team that is still figuring a lot of things out, and values trust, openness, and collaboration while doing so.

We explicitly encourage applications from groups that are underrepresented in tech. We celebrate and encourage diversity of race, religion, color, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, age and thought. Diversity is easier said than done but it's one of our founding principles to provide a diverse and inclusive environment.

Working at Garden
A culture fostering individuals and teams to do their best work in a friendly, positive, diverse and inclusive environment.
A policy of no meetings Tuesday through Thursday. We respect your right to Deep Work.
Competitive compensation
You can work fully remote or join us at our HQ in vibrant Berlin, Germany (see Remote's Country Explorer for a list of all countries we support)
Wellness stipend and membership in Berlin
Your own work computer of your choice with OS of your choice (macOS, Linux, or Windows)
2000 euro yearly professional development stipend

Our Process

We're a small team that tries to keep things simple and lean—and that applies to our interview process as well.

The first step is an intro call with our Director of People. The goal is to give both parties a chance to get to know each other, ask questions and discuss the culture at Garden, as well as to talk about salary and availability. The next step is an Interview with someone from our Community Engineering team and CTO. The goal is to give both parties a chance to get to know one another and to discuss the role.

After that you'll have a 60-minute technical interview with our engineers. We have a real conversation about things you've actually done in the past and dig deep into those.

The final step is a 60-minute demo + Q&A. In the demo you present work you've done in the past to people from our engineering teams. We want everyone involved in the process, so this is also a chance for you to meet the rest of the team and vice versa."

We raised our Series C funding in March 2022 for $105M at a $2.1B valuation. We continued to see exponential revenue growth last year. Join us for a whale of a ride!

About Us

Docker is a remote first company with employees across Europe and the Americas. We value transparency and asynchronous communication, but also arrange meetups and offsites to allow people to work together in person.

At Docker, we empower developers to make world-changing apps. Docker helps developers bring their ideas to reality by conquering the complexity of app development using container images. The Supply Chain team is looking to solve the following problems:
What insights can we give developers about their images and build processes?
How can developers keep their software dependencies up to date and secure?
What data can we put at developers' fingertips to supercharge their daily work?
How can developers build on expertise and pre-existing solutions within their organization?

To solve these problems, the Supply Chain team experiments on and delivers various features using data, iterating quickly on prototypes inside Docker Desktop, Docker Hub, and a new cross-registry initiative. We’re centered around a large data plane with integrations to container registries and source control systems. We use this data to provide developers with insights and new functionality.

Who We’re Looking For

We have a variety of backend opportunities at different parts of the stack, including infrastructure and platform engineering, integrations with other web services, and customer-facing applications on both web and desktop, and we welcome applicants who are interested in any of these areas. We use various languages, but particularly Golang.

We work in a multi-cloud environment, making use of the best parts of GCP and AWS. We use a variety of databases including Datomic, Postgres and DynamoDB. Much of the backend is asynchronous and queues are center stage in our architecture. We use Kubernetes to run our services, and serverless technology where appropriate. Our services build automatically and are deployed into production with a click of a button. We believe in making small changes and deploying regularly.

The ideal candidate will have a strong desire to investigate and learn new technologies. In return, we offer you the unique opportunity to build world-class tools to help millions of developers like you.

Qualifications
3+ years experience in backend engineering.
Proficiency in modern programming languages.
Comfortable following software engineering best practices such as code review, source control, continuous integration, and testing.
Comfortable with a high degree of autonomy (self-motivated, organized) and the ability to work remotely across time zones.
Eager to work with and learn new tools and technologies.
Able to communicate concepts clearly and be understood by non-technical peers.

„First-Level-Support & QA“

Was sind deine Aufgaben…
Als First-Level-Supporter:in bist du Ansprechpartner:in für unsere Kunden, wenn es um technische Fragen, Erklärungen des Tools und Nutzerprobleme geht.
Als Schnittstelle zwischen Kunden und internen Teams liebst du den Austausch mit unseren Usern, nimmst fachliche und technische Anfragen, Fehlermeldungen und Störungen per Telefon oder E-Mail entgegen und bearbeitest diese eigenständig.
Du testest die berichteten Nutzerprobleme nach und dokumentierst diese auf Englisch in unserem Ticket-System (JIRA).
Du bist technisch so erfahren, dass du auch das Testen von Neu- und Weiterentwicklungen übernimmst.
Frontend-Testing ist dein Ding! Du magst es, dafür zu sorgen, dass neue Features fehlerfrei implementiert werden.
Ein gut funktionierendes Produkt steht für dich an oberster Stelle. Daher testest du explizit die Kernfunktionalität sowie wichtige Anwendungsfälle unserer Software und stellst die Ergebnisse ungefiltert unserem Entwicklungsteam vor.
Dein Qualitätsbewusstsein sichert eine zeitnahe Lösung kritischer Bugs und leitet alle notwendigen Schritte für den erfolgreichen Release unserer Softwarelösungen ein.
Du bist verantwortlich für die eigenständige Planung und Durchführung von Softwaretests, Erarbeitung von Testkonzepten, -spezifikationen und Testfällen. Auch die Erstellung von Anwenderdokumentationen liegt in deinem Verantwortungsbereich.
Du behältst den Überblick über laufende Tickets und informierst unsere Kunden über bereitstehende Lösungen.
Dank deiner positiven Einstellung, Kommunikationsstärke, Geduld und Freundlichkeit sorgst du für einen reibungslosen Ablauf der Kundeninteraktion und -kommunikation.

Du bist souverän im Umgang mit den gängigen digitalen Arbeitsmitteln, wie z.B. Jira, MS Teams, MS Office, GSuite.
Selbstständiges Arbeiten sowie ein kluges und effektives Zeitmanagement sind für dich selbstverständlich. Prokrastination ist für dich aufgrund deines Drives und deiner Disziplin ein Fremdwort. Dennoch weißt du, wann du auf dich achten musst.
Du bist ein proaktiver Lösungsfinder, absoluter Teamplayer. Dazu gehört nicht nur, dass du konstruktive Kritik wertschätzt, sondern dich auch selbstbewusst mit Kritik und Verbesserungsvorschlägen gegenüber deinen Kolleginnen, Vorgesetzten und Kunden einbringst.

We raised our Series C funding in March 2022 for $105M at a $2.1B valuation. We continued to see exponential revenue growth last year. Join us for a whale of a ride!

About Us

Docker is a remote first company with employees across Europe and the Americas. We value transparency and asynchronous communication, but also arrange meetups and offsites to allow people to work together in person.

At Docker, we empower developers to make world-changing apps. Docker helps developers bring their ideas to reality by conquering the complexity of app development using container images. The Supply Chain team is looking to solve the following problems:
What insights can we give developers about their images and build processes?
How can developers keep their software dependencies up to date and secure?
What data can we put at developers' fingertips to supercharge their daily work?
How can developers build on expertise and pre-existing solutions within their organization?

To solve these problems, the Supply Chain team experiments on and delivers various features using data, iterating quickly on prototypes inside Docker Desktop, Docker Hub, and a new cross-registry initiative. We’re centered around a large data plane with integrations to container registries and source control systems. We use this data to provide developers with insights and new functionality.

Who We’re Looking For

We have a variety of backend opportunities at different parts of the stack, including infrastructure and platform engineering, integrations with other web services, and customer-facing applications on both web and desktop, and we welcome applicants who are interested in any of these areas. We use various languages, but particularly Golang.

We work in a multi-cloud environment, making use of the best parts of GCP and AWS. We use a variety of databases including Datomic, Postgres and DynamoDB. Much of the backend is asynchronous and queues are center stage in our architecture. We use Kubernetes to run our services, and serverless technology where appropriate. Our services build automatically and are deployed into production with a click of a button. We believe in making small changes and deploying regularly.

The ideal candidate will have a strong desire to investigate and learn new technologies. In return, we offer you the unique opportunity to build world-class tools to help millions of developers like you.

Qualifications
3+ years experience in backend engineering.
Proficiency in modern programming languages.
Comfortable following software engineering best practices such as code review, source control, continuous integration, and testing.
Comfortable with a high degree of autonomy (self-motivated, organized) and the ability to work remotely across time zones.

Able to communicate concepts clearly and be understood by non-technical peers.

Our Commitments:

We act like owners - We are relentlessly delivering for our users and spending money thoughtfully.
We embrace embarrassing honesty - We function best when we're open and honest with one another — especially about our challenges and doubts.
We have a bias to action - We get to first outcomes quickly, iterate and learn.
We strive to be better - We may make mistakes, but always learn from them.
We are inclusive - to better reflect and serve our users.

Your key area of focus:

A good CI/CD pipeline helps our engineers deliver features quickly, efficiently, and safely to production. A Senior Developer Tooling Engineer at Zepz aims to apply the same principles to our tooling that supports our wider engineering organization.

You’ll be working on automating complex processes, reducing manual steps in day-to-day workloads, improving infrastructure health visibility, and improving our engineers' delivery of code. You'll take on the burden of managing how software gets delivered to production and ensuring that our infrastructure just works. In short, you’ll provide leverage for the other engineers at Zepz to continue making sending money as easy and simple as sending a text.

In the first few months, you’ll:

Work on improving our development tools and experience so that engineers can ship work faster.
Build tools to help increase visibility into more opaque processes and pipelines.
Create automation for manual tasks, or workflows that span multiple different sources.
Explore and evaluate third-party or in-house solutions for complex process problems.
Participate in an on-call rotation to handle problems outside of business hours so that our system is always available to our users
Uncover bottlenecks in our software delivery process and improve them.
What you bring to the table:

3+ years of professional experience in DevOps, SRE, Software Development, or an equivalent field.
Experience working closely with key stakeholders across an organization's development, operations, and business units.
2+ years working with AWS or Google Cloud.
Proficient in code deployment tools (Terraform, Puppet, Ansible, Chef)
Experienced with scripting (Bash, Python)
Experience working with Git and other CI/CD tools and pipelines.
Bonus points if you:

Are a creative and flexible problem solver, and interested in finding the best solutions for our particular needs
Like getting in the weeds and making projects happen
Are excited about multiple kinds of work and want to help out where it’s needed
Are comfortable defaulting to over-communication and overreaching when it comes to coordination.
Adjust quickly to changing priorities and conditions and cope effectively with complexity and change.
Have created BI dashboards and tooling in a previous role.
Have experience with Load/Stress testing and tools.
Have experience with service-based architectures.

What we offer you:

We have five core benefits for our talent in the US, UK, Philippines, Poland, and South Africa. If you're not in one of those regions, don’t worry - the Talent team can let you know what is available for you specifically:

Unlimited Annual Leave: Most Zepz team members are eligible for unlimited annual leave. Colleagues in customer-facing roles, and those who qualify for overtime, receive a competitive holiday allowance and four recharge days a year. Feel free to make the most of your time off and maintain a healthy work-life balance!
Private Medical Cover: You can opt-in to a Private Medical Insurance scheme. This provides you with access to thorough medical coverage, so you can feel confident in your health and well-being.
Retirement: We offer pension schemes to help you plan for and secure your future.
Life Assurance: Life assurance is available to give you peace of mind and protect your loved ones in case of the unexpected.
Parental Leave: We offer competitive parental leave schemes to ensure you are spending as much quality time with your new bundle of joy as possible.

We are also remote-first as an organisation, offering flexibility for you to work where you need to be most productive. In many locations, we have workspaces, which you can use as you desire.

Most roles in the Philippines are predominately office-based, with this we offer free meals for those 100% on-site.

In addition to the above, you will discover that we have a range of secondary perks (such as the cycle-to-work scheme and employee discounts) depending on your location, to help you thrive at Zepz!

Why choose Zepz?

Our team of over 1600+ employees is fully distributed across the world. We are working from coffee shops, homes, and co-working spaces — making us one of the larger fully distributed growth-stage startups in the world but we also offer workspace in our talent cluster locations - spaces we can meet, collaborate and connect.
We are proud parents, community organizers, farmers, band members, yoga teachers, YouTube influencers, former Olympians, and serial entrepreneurs.
We collectively speak over twenty languages, including Akuapem, Amharic, Bengali, Ewe, Fante, Ga, Igbo, Kalenjin, Luganda, Oromo, Somali, Swahili, Wolof, Bulgarian, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Estonian, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hungarian, Irish, Italian, Latvian, Lithuanian, Maltese, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Slovak, Slovenian, Spanish and Swedish.
At Zepz, embodying our commitments binds us together. We are collectively passionate about striving to achieve our vision and purpose - to continue to provide the best service to our users.
Ready to apply?

Applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis. If interested, please submit your resume along with a cover letter (optional), highlighting why your experience demonstrates you meet the requirements of the role. Please also indicate the countries in which you have work authorization. While Zepz supports visa sponsorship, sponsorship opportunities may be limited to certain roles and skills.

At Zepz we record interviews using Metaview ( https://metaview.ai ). It helps us become better interviewers by recording and transcribing our interviews, and ensures we interview candidates in a fair & consistent manner. It is not required. Please let us know if you’d like to opt out of the use of Metaview - this will not affect the outcome of your interview.

Confidence can sometimes hold us back from applying for a job. But we'll let you in on a secret: there's no such thing as a 'perfect' candidate. Zepz is a place where everyone can thrive.

So however you identify and whatever background you bring with you, and if at all you might need any form of support to make the process as comfortable as possible, please let us know and give us a shot by applying. We want you to be excited to wake up to make an impact every day."

Our customers are at the forefront of some of the most interesting data in the world, using SingleStore to push the boundaries every day. To do this well, they leverage the expertise of our Support Engineering Team, composed of technical subject matter experts on the frontlines of critical customer issues.

This Support Engineering role skews far more towards engineering than typical technical support as you will need to delve into database internals and memory allocators, diagnose complex SQL query behavior, and investigate Linux and Kubernetes related configurations, all in the name of resolving complex product issues. Our Support Engineers are constantly learning a wide range of customer systems and technical concepts and are thrilled by the new and exciting challenges that they encounter each day.

To accurately identify the source and solution of an issue, this team will take the time to learn about the customer’s business and systems while helping to improve their fundamental SingleStore and database operational knowledge. This often requires additional research and time spent on learning new technologies and tools outside of just the database engine while also being deeply engaged with multiple departments including development teams, query performance engineering, product management, infrastructure SREs, etc.

Role And Responsibilities

Provide product support to our on-premise and cloud hosted enterprise customers, acting as the first-line-of-defense for complex technical issues, bug diagnosis, or resolving critical outages.
Identify and reproduce product issues and submit formal bug reports or feature requests to the appropriate Engineering team.
Understand and help to improve complex SQL behavior to diagnose bugs or improve performance.
Collaborate with software developers, sales engineers, and technical account managers to keep all teams up to date with current issues a customer may be facing.
Work to streamline and improve various Support and Engineering processes and tools, author new knowledge base articles and run-books, and help the team continually improve efficiency and effectiveness.
Participate in our on-call rotation that may include weekends and holidays.

Required Skills And Experience

4+ years of previous customer-facing advanced technical support experience.
Previous experience as a DBA or Support Engineer at a database company.
Experience with SQL databases and advanced SQL query optimization and tuning. You should be familiar enough with at least one commercial or open source database to decipher its EXPLAIN plan and understand potential performance impact or ways to improve the query.
Strong background in general product troubleshooting, keeping in mind that query processing issues can be impacted by database or linux configuration and resource availability.
A solid linux performance background. That means you are hands-on with Linux and your skills include generating and reading flame graphs, checking system resource utilization, and parsing verbose log files. Bonus points for familiarity with Kubernetes.
Experience with a scripting or coding language. Whether it’s C++, Python, Go, or Bash, you should have a go-to solution for quick problem-solving and be able to navigate through our extensive code base.
Familiarity with distributed systems and AWS/GCP. You understand how organizations deploy and maintain distributed applications and services across multiple machines and know how to analyze these systems for performance bottlenecks.
Experience improving support processes regarding ticket triage, escalation, and reporting business metrics back to the organization.
Strong written and verbal English communication skills. Have the ability to explain technical concepts to a wide range of end-users.

SingleStore is one platform for all data, built so you can engage with insight in every moment. Trusted by industry leaders, SingleStore enables enterprises to adapt to change as it happens, embrace diverse data with ease, and accelerate the pace of innovation. SingleStore is venture-backed and headquartered in San Francisco with offices in Portland, Seattle, Boston, Bangalore, London, Lisbon, and Kyiv. Defining the future starts with The Database of Now™.

Consistent with our commitment to diversity & inclusion, we value individuals with the ability to work on diverse teams and with a diverse range of people.

To all recruitment agencies: SingleStore does not accept agency resumes. Please do not forward resumes to SingleStore employees. SingleStore is not responsible for any fees related to unsolicited resumes and will not pay fees to any third-party agency or company that does not have a signed agreement with the Company.

Our customers are at the forefront of some of the most interesting data in the world, using SingleStore to push the boundaries every day. To do this well, they leverage the expertise of our Support Engineering Team, composed of technical subject matter experts on the frontlines of critical customer issues.

This Support Engineering role skews far more towards engineering than typical technical support as you will need to delve into database internals and memory allocators, diagnose complex SQL query behavior, and investigate Linux and Kubernetes related configurations, all in the name of resolving complex product issues. Our Support Engineers are constantly learning a wide range of customer systems and technical concepts and are thrilled by the new and exciting challenges that they encounter each day.

To accurately identify the source and solution of an issue, this team will take the time to learn about the customer’s business and systems while helping to improve their fundamental SingleStore and database operational knowledge. This often requires additional research and time spent on learning new technologies and tools outside of just the database engine while also being deeply engaged with multiple departments including development teams, query performance engineering, product management, infrastructure SREs, etc.

Role And Responsibilities

Provide product support to our on-premise and cloud hosted enterprise customers, acting as the first-line-of-defense for complex technical issues, bug diagnosis, or resolving critical outages.
Identify and reproduce product issues and submit formal bug reports or feature requests to the appropriate Engineering team.
Understand and help to improve complex SQL behavior to diagnose bugs or improve performance.
Collaborate with software developers, sales engineers, and technical account managers to keep all teams up to date with current issues a customer may be facing.
Work to streamline and improve various Support and Engineering processes and tools, author new knowledge base articles and run-books, and help the team continually improve efficiency and effectiveness.
Participate in our on-call rotation that may include weekends and holidays.

Required Skills And Experience

4+ years of previous customer-facing advanced technical support experience.
Previous experience as a DBA or Support Engineer at a database company.
Experience with SQL databases and advanced SQL query optimization and tuning. You should be familiar enough with at least one commercial or open source database to decipher its EXPLAIN plan and understand potential performance impact or ways to improve the query.
Strong background in general product troubleshooting, keeping in mind that query processing issues can be impacted by database or linux configuration and resource availability.
A solid linux performance background. That means you are hands-on with Linux and your skills include generating and reading flame graphs, checking system resource utilization, and parsing verbose log files. Bonus points for familiarity with Kubernetes.
Experience with a scripting or coding language. Whether it’s C++, Python, Go, or Bash, you should have a go-to solution for quick problem-solving and be able to navigate through our extensive code base.
Familiarity with distributed systems and AWS/GCP. You understand how organizations deploy and maintain distributed applications and services across multiple machines and know how to analyze these systems for performance bottlenecks.
Experience improving support processes regarding ticket triage, escalation, and reporting business metrics back to the organization.
Strong written and verbal English communication skills. Have the ability to explain technical concepts to a wide range of end-users.

SingleStore is one platform for all data, built so you can engage with insight in every moment. Trusted by industry leaders, SingleStore enables enterprises to adapt to change as it happens, embrace diverse data with ease, and accelerate the pace of innovation. SingleStore is venture-backed and headquartered in San Francisco with offices in Portland, Seattle, Boston, Bangalore, London, Lisbon, and Kyiv. Defining the future starts with The Database of Now™.

Consistent with our commitment to diversity & inclusion, we value individuals with the ability to work on diverse teams and with a diverse range of people.

To all recruitment agencies: SingleStore does not accept agency resumes. Please do not forward resumes to SingleStore employees. SingleStore is not responsible for any fees related to unsolicited resumes and will not pay fees to any third-party agency or company that does not have a signed agreement with the Company.

Telnyx is a global connectivity platform and partner that powers carrier-grade services on an in-house built, private, cloud-agnostic IP network. We power voice, messaging, video, wireless, numbering, fax, security, and networking solutions for businesses all around the world. Whether we’re processing mission-critical communications, hosting enterprise-grade contact centers, or powering simple in-app messaging and calling, our APIs make secure, high-fidelity connectivity the new standard. We’re working to democratize worldwide access to real-time communications over the internet.

The Role

We’re looking for a Mobile App Engineer to work on our iOS and Android Voice & Video SDKs, that enable our customers to add real-time communications into their apps. Telnyx’s SDKs are building blocks from which customers create voice, video and data applications of the future, leveraging our world-wide network for the highest quality real-time streaming. This role is for a seasoned engineer looking for an experience leading native mobile efforts at a fast-paced startup.

In This Role You Will

Lead Telnyx native mobile projects, starting with our Voice and Video SDKs.
Collaborate with telephony and web developers to create iOS and Android SDKs with a laser focus on developer experience.
Make improvements to native mobile projects based on early adopters feedback.
Craft durable, well-tested code with an unwavering commitment to product quality.
Create sample applications and work with our Sales Engineers to display Voice and Video applications to potential customers.
Learn the technology behind voice and video calls and how to use it to enable applications that connect people through our world-wide private network.

You’d Be A Good Fit If You Have

Experience working on challenging iOS and Android projects in an agile environment, using Swift, Objective-C, Kotlin, or Java.
Published native mobile open-source libraries.
You take a thoughtful approach to decision making, knowing when to move fast and when to long-term optimize.
You want to work in a fast-paced, product-driven environment.
You keep up to date with the latest frontend technologies and patterns, and enjoy sharing what you’ve learned.
You’re interested in creating proof of concepts with cutting edge technologies.
You’re willing to learn the telephony technology behind voice and video calls.

What It Is Like To Work At Telnyx

Telnyx is a complex machine with a simple purpose: connect people. We are an intelligent telephony engine, the beating heart of the Telnyx service that routes data along the pathways of our global, private network. We are drop-in APIs for hooking applications into our products, and an administrator portal that puts unprecedented control of configuring and orchestrating the Telnyx service into our customers’ hands.

We’re also an organization of industry experts and engineers focused on solving problems and building solutions. We’re a concierge customer success team and a 24/7 support team. We’re a communications partner, focused on agile and endless innovation, not a telecom slogged in antiquated processes and anti-competitive regulation. We keep the conversation going: the always-on, omnichannel, enriched conversation that the modern world demands.

Communications are coming untethered from devices, and more and more, they’re migrating into our everyday platforms: our social media, our work applications, and our collaboration tools. But, that move started before there was infrastructure to support it—the modern internet will never offer the speed and consistency that real-time communications require. So, we built a network that does and a cloud platform tuned for real-time communications at every layer. Telnyx is the connective matrix, a worldwide nervous system, a high-speed rail tunneling through the information superhighway. We’re the foundation for calls, texts and messaging today, for the internet of things, augmented reality and “communitainment” tomorrow, and for whatever enterprising imaginations can dream up after that.

We’re Telnyx. We’re the future of communications.

At Telnyx, we're looking for people with passion, grit, and integrity. You're encouraged to apply even if your experience doesn't precisely match the job description. Your skills and passion will stand out—and set you apart—especially if your career has taken some extraordinary twists and turns. At Telnyx, we welcome diverse perspectives and people who think rigorously and aren't afraid to challenge assumptions. Join us.

Bring Your Authentic Self to Telnyx

Telnyx is committed to building a team full of diverse perspectives, various backgrounds and different minds. We believe diversity drives innovation. We are committed to building a culture where difference is valued and creating avenues of equity for underserved groups. While we are still a work in progress, we are actively seeking folks who are passionate about building a place of belonging for everyone.

How We Work

We’re a connectivity and networking leader, with industry experts and engineers who have built our cloud-agnostic platform in-house, from the ground up. We’re a concierge customer success team and a 24/7 support team. We’re a communications partner, focused on agile innovation, not a telecom slogged in antiquated processes and anti-competitive regulation. We’re an enterprise-grade conversation enabler, powering the global, enriched, multi-channel communications that today’s customers demand.

We're looking for people with passion, grit, and integrity. We believe in transparency, proactivity, and mutual respect. We provide the high-grade tools that help you do your best work, and keep up the collaborative habits that help everyone stay in the loop. No matter where you're based or which team you’re on, you’re plugged in, supported, and helping to shape the future of communications.

You're encouraged to apply even if your experience doesn't precisely match the job description. Your skills and passion will stand out—and set you apart—especially if your career has taken some extraordinary twists and turns. At Telnyx, we welcome diverse perspectives, rigorous thinkers and assumption challengers. Are you ready to join us?"

We launched in January 2017 and since attracted 190k+ of the most talented creatives around the globe and hundreds of high profile organizations and brands. We’re a focused and lean, yet very effective team based in Germany, UK, USA, India, Brazil and Indonesia – we communicate in English only.

This role is for you if you have extensive experience in developing, shipping, maintaining and operating scalable and secure applications both in front- and backend. You’re self-organized and you know how to set and communicate priorities in order to achieve objectives. You know how to manage yourself, ideally you proved that by running your own business or side project. You’re excited about learning and sharing your knowledge with your team. You’re obsessed about quality and have pleasure in automating repetitive tasks.

We work almost entirely in Typescript. Our web apps are built in React (lately with Next.js) and backends are running in Node with Postgres.

Manage and oversee internal standards for style, maintainability, and best practices through code review
Automate! We’re a small team with high output. Test-automation is key to maintain continuous delivery of value to our users. We are doing ok in this area, but there’s still a lot to gain.
Constantly learn and improve. 10% of our time is reserved for learning and another 10% for improving internal processes (automation, testing, developer experience, infrastructure and code maintainability etc.)

Requirements
3+ years experience developing backend architecture and RESTful APIs with minimal guidance (bonus: experience with GraphQL backends)
3+ years experience developing frontend applications with React (bonus: experience with Next.js)

We're entrepreneurial and focused: tackling problems head-on without ego.

We highly value each other's time in order to maximize our impact. To achieve this, we do extensive research and write specifications before building, invest in automation, and practice efficient and deliberate communication. We believe it is important to have long stretches of uninterrupted focus time, so we keep meetings to a minimum. On average, you will not have more than 2 hours of meetings per week, including a 1:1.
Our headquarter is based in Munich, Germany, but we’re a fully remote company. This is a remote role. While you can live and work wherever you want, at least 6h of your working hours should happen from 9 to 5 in Central European time (UTC+1).
We embrace learning and experimentation. We encourage you to use 10% of your working hours to learn and experiment with new technology, read mind blowing books and blogs or do online courses.
We respect your personal life and provide a family friendly working environment. While we love what we’re doing and are very dedicated to our jobs and the company, we still know what really matters: family and friends. Most of us have kids and share care work equally with our partners, so we know what we’re talking about ;)
20 paid vacation days + public German holidays (to keep organization simple)
32h work week (most of us work on 4 days, some split their off day into two half days, but that’s up to you)
A fair salary + Virtual Employee Stock Ownership Plans (VSOPs)

At Picter, we believe that it takes a diversity of thought, culture, race, sexual orientation, and outlook to build a world-class business. We value unique contributions and welcome people of all backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives to join us."

Telnyx is a global connectivity platform and partner that powers carrier-grade services on an in-house built, private, cloud-agnostic IP network. We power voice, messaging, video, wireless, numbering, fax, security, and networking solutions for businesses all around the world. Whether we’re processing mission-critical communications, hosting enterprise-grade contact centers, or powering simple in-app messaging and calling, our APIs make secure, high-fidelity connectivity the new standard. We’re working to democratize worldwide access to real-time communications over the internet.

The Role

We’re looking for a Mobile App Engineer to work on our iOS and Android Voice & Video SDKs, that enable our customers to add real-time communications into their apps. Telnyx’s SDKs are building blocks from which customers create voice, video and data applications of the future, leveraging our world-wide network for the highest quality real-time streaming. This role is for a seasoned engineer looking for an experience leading native mobile efforts at a fast-paced startup.

In This Role You Will

Lead Telnyx native mobile projects, starting with our Voice and Video SDKs.
Collaborate with telephony and web developers to create iOS and Android SDKs with a laser focus on developer experience.
Make improvements to native mobile projects based on early adopters feedback.
Craft durable, well-tested code with an unwavering commitment to product quality.
Create sample applications and work with our Sales Engineers to display Voice and Video applications to potential customers.
Learn the technology behind voice and video calls and how to use it to enable applications that connect people through our world-wide private network.

You’d Be A Good Fit If You Have

Experience working on challenging iOS and Android projects in an agile environment, using Swift, Objective-C, Kotlin, or Java.
Published native mobile open-source libraries.
You take a thoughtful approach to decision making, knowing when to move fast and when to long-term optimize.
You want to work in a fast-paced, product-driven environment.
You keep up to date with the latest frontend technologies and patterns, and enjoy sharing what you’ve learned.
You’re interested in creating proof of concepts with cutting edge technologies.
You’re willing to learn the telephony technology behind voice and video calls.

What It Is Like To Work At Telnyx

Telnyx is a complex machine with a simple purpose: connect people. We are an intelligent telephony engine, the beating heart of the Telnyx service that routes data along the pathways of our global, private network. We are drop-in APIs for hooking applications into our products, and an administrator portal that puts unprecedented control of configuring and orchestrating the Telnyx service into our customers’ hands.

We’re also an organization of industry experts and engineers focused on solving problems and building solutions. We’re a concierge customer success team and a 24/7 support team. We’re a communications partner, focused on agile and endless innovation, not a telecom slogged in antiquated processes and anti-competitive regulation. We keep the conversation going: the always-on, omnichannel, enriched conversation that the modern world demands.

Communications are coming untethered from devices, and more and more, they’re migrating into our everyday platforms: our social media, our work applications, and our collaboration tools. But, that move started before there was infrastructure to support it—the modern internet will never offer the speed and consistency that real-time communications require. So, we built a network that does and a cloud platform tuned for real-time communications at every layer. Telnyx is the connective matrix, a worldwide nervous system, a high-speed rail tunneling through the information superhighway. We’re the foundation for calls, texts and messaging today, for the internet of things, augmented reality and “communitainment” tomorrow, and for whatever enterprising imaginations can dream up after that.

We’re Telnyx. We’re the future of communications.

At Telnyx, we're looking for people with passion, grit, and integrity. You're encouraged to apply even if your experience doesn't precisely match the job description. Your skills and passion will stand out—and set you apart—especially if your career has taken some extraordinary twists and turns. At Telnyx, we welcome diverse perspectives and people who think rigorously and aren't afraid to challenge assumptions. Join us.

Bring Your Authentic Self to Telnyx

Telnyx is committed to building a team full of diverse perspectives, various backgrounds and different minds. We believe diversity drives innovation. We are committed to building a culture where difference is valued and creating avenues of equity for underserved groups. While we are still a work in progress, we are actively seeking folks who are passionate about building a place of belonging for everyone.

How We Work

We’re a connectivity and networking leader, with industry experts and engineers who have built our cloud-agnostic platform in-house, from the ground up. We’re a concierge customer success team and a 24/7 support team. We’re a communications partner, focused on agile innovation, not a telecom slogged in antiquated processes and anti-competitive regulation. We’re an enterprise-grade conversation enabler, powering the global, enriched, multi-channel communications that today’s customers demand.

We're looking for people with passion, grit, and integrity. We believe in transparency, proactivity, and mutual respect. We provide the high-grade tools that help you do your best work, and keep up the collaborative habits that help everyone stay in the loop. No matter where you're based or which team you’re on, you’re plugged in, supported, and helping to shape the future of communications.

You're encouraged to apply even if your experience doesn't precisely match the job description. Your skills and passion will stand out—and set you apart—especially if your career has taken some extraordinary twists and turns. At Telnyx, we welcome diverse perspectives, rigorous thinkers and assumption challengers. Are you ready to join us?"

Telnyx is a global connectivity platform and partner that powers carrier-grade services on an in-house built, private, cloud-agnostic IP network. We power voice, messaging, video, wireless, numbering, fax, security, and networking solutions for businesses all around the world. Whether we’re processing mission-critical communications, hosting enterprise-grade contact centers, or powering simple in-app messaging and calling, our APIs make secure, high-fidelity connectivity the new standard. We’re working to democratize worldwide access to real-time communications over the internet.

The Role

We’re looking for a Mobile App Engineer to work on our iOS and Android Voice & Video SDKs, that enable our customers to add real-time communications into their apps. Telnyx’s SDKs are building blocks from which customers create voice, video and data applications of the future, leveraging our world-wide network for the highest quality real-time streaming. This role is for a seasoned engineer looking for an experience leading native mobile efforts at a fast-paced startup.

In This Role You Will

Lead Telnyx native mobile projects, starting with our Voice and Video SDKs.
Collaborate with telephony and web developers to create iOS and Android SDKs with a laser focus on developer experience.
Make improvements to native mobile projects based on early adopters feedback.
Craft durable, well-tested code with an unwavering commitment to product quality.
Create sample applications and work with our Sales Engineers to display Voice and Video applications to potential customers.
Learn the technology behind voice and video calls and how to use it to enable applications that connect people through our world-wide private network.

You’d Be A Good Fit If You Have

Experience working on challenging iOS and Android projects in an agile environment, using Swift, Objective-C, Kotlin, or Java.
Published native mobile open-source libraries.
You take a thoughtful approach to decision making, knowing when to move fast and when to long-term optimize.
You want to work in a fast-paced, product-driven environment.
You keep up to date with the latest frontend technologies and patterns, and enjoy sharing what you’ve learned.
You’re interested in creating proof of concepts with cutting edge technologies.
You’re willing to learn the telephony technology behind voice and video calls.

What It Is Like To Work At Telnyx

Telnyx is a complex machine with a simple purpose: connect people. We are an intelligent telephony engine, the beating heart of the Telnyx service that routes data along the pathways of our global, private network. We are drop-in APIs for hooking applications into our products, and an administrator portal that puts unprecedented control of configuring and orchestrating the Telnyx service into our customers’ hands.

We’re also an organization of industry experts and engineers focused on solving problems and building solutions. We’re a concierge customer success team and a 24/7 support team. We’re a communications partner, focused on agile and endless innovation, not a telecom slogged in antiquated processes and anti-competitive regulation. We keep the conversation going: the always-on, omnichannel, enriched conversation that the modern world demands.

Communications are coming untethered from devices, and more and more, they’re migrating into our everyday platforms: our social media, our work applications, and our collaboration tools. But, that move started before there was infrastructure to support it—the modern internet will never offer the speed and consistency that real-time communications require. So, we built a network that does and a cloud platform tuned for real-time communications at every layer. Telnyx is the connective matrix, a worldwide nervous system, a high-speed rail tunneling through the information superhighway. We’re the foundation for calls, texts and messaging today, for the internet of things, augmented reality and “communitainment” tomorrow, and for whatever enterprising imaginations can dream up after that.

We’re Telnyx. We’re the future of communications.

At Telnyx, we're looking for people with passion, grit, and integrity. You're encouraged to apply even if your experience doesn't precisely match the job description. Your skills and passion will stand out—and set you apart—especially if your career has taken some extraordinary twists and turns. At Telnyx, we welcome diverse perspectives and people who think rigorously and aren't afraid to challenge assumptions. Join us.

Bring Your Authentic Self to Telnyx

Telnyx is committed to building a team full of diverse perspectives, various backgrounds and different minds. We believe diversity drives innovation. We are committed to building a culture where difference is valued and creating avenues of equity for underserved groups. While we are still a work in progress, we are actively seeking folks who are passionate about building a place of belonging for everyone.

How We Work

We’re a connectivity and networking leader, with industry experts and engineers who have built our cloud-agnostic platform in-house, from the ground up. We’re a concierge customer success team and a 24/7 support team. We’re a communications partner, focused on agile innovation, not a telecom slogged in antiquated processes and anti-competitive regulation. We’re an enterprise-grade conversation enabler, powering the global, enriched, multi-channel communications that today’s customers demand.

We're looking for people with passion, grit, and integrity. We believe in transparency, proactivity, and mutual respect. We provide the high-grade tools that help you do your best work, and keep up the collaborative habits that help everyone stay in the loop. No matter where you're based or which team you’re on, you’re plugged in, supported, and helping to shape the future of communications.

You're encouraged to apply even if your experience doesn't precisely match the job description. Your skills and passion will stand out—and set you apart—especially if your career has taken some extraordinary twists and turns. At Telnyx, we welcome diverse perspectives, rigorous thinkers and assumption challengers. Are you ready to join us?"

De jonge Anthony Fokker had altijd al grote plannen, en is zijn nalatenschap nooit verloren. Want het aanpakken van grote uitdagingen ligt nu nog steeds geheel in lijn met de huidige uitdagingen. Zo ook op het gebied van duurzaamheid. Momenteel werken we aan een emissievrij regionaal vliegtuig voor 48 passagiers. Het vliegtuig vliegt dan met nul CO2-emissies en nul NOx-emissies. Met als enige bijproduct: water. Dus we staan als Fokker | GKN Aerospace niet aan de zijlijn van de huidige transities, maar we maken het ook echt werkelijkheid. Hier zitten de talenten met de juiste vaardigheden en passie voor hun vak die bezig zijn met de hoogste kwaliteitseisen.

Groei en ontwikkeling

De checks en screenings zullen beoordeeld worden aan de hand van kaders die door onze afdeling Export Compliance & Security gesteld worden.

Beoordeling van checks en screenings kan er toe leiden dat er geen inhoud gegeven kan worden aan de functie en er zodoende geen dienstverband of inzet kan volgen. De onboarding bij Fokker neemt doorgaand 3 weken in beslag.

How do you know if you want to work at InnovationCast?

You seek to learn and want to grow personally and professionally. The real magic of innovation happens when committed people work smarter to turn ideas into new value. If we don’t become better at what we do, we won’t help our customers do the same. So if you value repetition more than discovery, this job is not for you.

You want to do work that matters for people who care. We’re a startup working to solve a big and relevant problem - one that won’t go away. Helping our customers to get better results through innovation management is - and will ever be - a work in progress. But it is so important and makes a difference for so many people, that the mission inspires you.

You welcome change and actually like to drive it. We strive to give our customers the best tools so they can keep making progress with innovation. This means that we have to experiment a lot with new ideas. As expected, some of them will work, others won’t. You need to be willing to be wrong, not afraid to make mistakes and actively learn from the process.

You don’t want to be micromanaged and want to bring actionable ideas to the team. Innovation is a team sport. Sometimes your work will seem tricky and confusing because you will be working on something that doesn’t exist yet. You will reflect on and understand our thinking and be humble to ask for help, and share difficulties and potential ways forward. But you don’t expect to be given a checklist. When you feel others may be wrong, you speak up and explain your point of view. You value honest communication.

You believe innovation and entrepreneurship can help companies change the way they work and how business is done. You may even want to become an entrepreneur. We’re set to use innovation management and entrepreneurship practices to provide software that helps companies think and act differently at scale. By opening innovation to employees, customers and partners, organizations can explore unforeseen possibilities and make real progress they couldn’t do on their own.

About InnovationCast

We’re a rapidly growing startup with an excellent SaaS product used by top brands globally. And we are on a mission to change the way organizations innovate: for better and for good. Want to join us?

InnovationCast is the collaborative innovation management software (SaaS) that helps organizations discover, incubate, and accelerate ideas. In short, we connect people and ideas and enable them to bring the best ideas to life and make a difference.

We have fantastic customers like DHL, Mayo Clinic, or Delta. We’re backed by Indico Capital, Shilling Capital and accelerated by Google for Startups.

We make innovation simpler, faster, more productive, and even fun. We believe that innovation and entrepreneurship mindsets and practices will become part of how people work daily. And we are set to make it possible and accessible for companies of all shapes and sizes.

Would you like to join a growing team and have an impact on the development of a world-class product? Do you want to work on a software used by thousands of people from top brands worldwide, which is used to innovate on new products, business models, and even social challenges? Then this job may be for you!"

You are experienced with Linux systems administration, package management, and operations
You have hands-on experience with at least one public cloud
You are familiar with Docker and Kubernetes

The investment was led by Goldman Sachs Asset Management with participation from Bain Capital Ventures and Sixth Street Growth. For more information, visit Bloomreach.com.

We are currently expanding our Application Platform team and we are looking for Backend Software Engineer. Is ""security"", ""curiosity"" or ""growth"" your middle name? Then you are a good fit and you can be one of us. You can work remotely or from one of our local offices. The salary starts at €3,000 based on your experience level.

About your role and the team:

The Application Platform team empowers other engineering teams to build their services effectively and with security and compliance built-in by designing, implementing, and maintaining the magic solid foundations and the core frameworks of the Bloomreach Engagement.

Examples of the initiatives driven by this team are:
Integrated zero-trust authentication and authorization management system.
Platform for collecting and processing audit logs in a distributed environment.
Notification center, which allows other teams to communicate information to customers through a single unified channel (upcoming project).

What you might like about this role:
Wide reach - we deal with teams across the company - product, security, architects, engineers, even customers.
Security perspective will be a key element of your day-to-day work
Developing Cloud Native services consumed by customers as well as other engineering teams

What your typical day might look like:

You start your day with a code review of your colleague’s tasks while sipping a cup of fresh-brewed tea or coffee, looking for any signs of problems and possible optimizations. Then you join your teammates on a quick daily standup, where you discuss what you’re currently working on and the plan for the next few days.

After the meeting, you get into “the zone” and spend a few undisturbed hours working on the new authentication framework while making sure it’s safely covered by a suite of unit tests. With a few clicks you quickly spin up a brand new instance of the system in the development cluster, deploy your change and notify the frontend engineer that it’s ready.

You grab a snack and take a little break from coding. Instead, you help a fellow backend engineer from another team figure out the best way to integrate their new service with the audit logging platform. In the meantime the frontend engineer gets back to you and confirms that all the new endpoints work as expected, so you create a merge request and ask your teammates for a code review. It’s a complex piece of code, so you go through it together.

After your code is approved, you merge it, automatically deploying it to the staging environment where it receives further testing by the QA team and automated integration tests before being released to production.

You end your day in a short meeting with a product manager and the director of engineering, where you flesh out the idea you had over lunch yesterday for a new approach to release management that would make the whole process even faster.

Our tech stack:
Python & Go
MongoDB, Redis, Apache Kafka
Kubernetes (GKE)
Various Google Cloud Platform services (Pub/Sub, BigTable, DataFlow, ...)
Gitlab CI/CD, Prometheus and Grafana

What we expect of the candidate:

The ideal candidate has:
At least 3 year experience developing in Python or Golang
Designing and implementing production-grade REST APIs
Having experience with operating services in production is beneficial
A working understanding of fundamental web security principles (OWASP), Authentication and Authorization practices
Experience with database systems of different kinds (MongoDB, Redis, Apache Kafka)

Regional benefits:
Monthly lunch entitlement by up to 110€ per month
Pension scheme or Health insurance depending on region

The investment was led by Goldman Sachs Asset Management with participation from Bain Capital Ventures and Sixth Street Growth. For more information, visit Bloomreach.com.

We are currently expanding our Application Platform team and we are looking for Backend Software Engineer. Is ""security"", ""curiosity"" or ""growth"" your middle name? Then you are a good fit and you can be one of us. You can work remotely or from one of our local offices. The salary starts at €3,000 based on your experience level.

About your role and the team:

The Application Platform team empowers other engineering teams to build their services effectively and with security and compliance built-in by designing, implementing, and maintaining the magic solid foundations and the core frameworks of the Bloomreach Engagement.

Examples of the initiatives driven by this team are:
Integrated zero-trust authentication and authorization management system.
Platform for collecting and processing audit logs in a distributed environment.
Notification center, which allows other teams to communicate information to customers through a single unified channel (upcoming project).

What you might like about this role:
Wide reach - we deal with teams across the company - product, security, architects, engineers, even customers.
Security perspective will be a key element of your day-to-day work
Developing Cloud Native services consumed by customers as well as other engineering teams

What your typical day might look like:

You start your day with a code review of your colleague’s tasks while sipping a cup of fresh-brewed tea or coffee, looking for any signs of problems and possible optimizations. Then you join your teammates on a quick daily standup, where you discuss what you’re currently working on and the plan for the next few days.

After the meeting, you get into “the zone” and spend a few undisturbed hours working on the new authentication framework while making sure it’s safely covered by a suite of unit tests. With a few clicks you quickly spin up a brand new instance of the system in the development cluster, deploy your change and notify the frontend engineer that it’s ready.

You grab a snack and take a little break from coding. Instead, you help a fellow backend engineer from another team figure out the best way to integrate their new service with the audit logging platform. In the meantime the frontend engineer gets back to you and confirms that all the new endpoints work as expected, so you create a merge request and ask your teammates for a code review. It’s a complex piece of code, so you go through it together.

After your code is approved, you merge it, automatically deploying it to the staging environment where it receives further testing by the QA team and automated integration tests before being released to production.

You end your day in a short meeting with a product manager and the director of engineering, where you flesh out the idea you had over lunch yesterday for a new approach to release management that would make the whole process even faster.

Our tech stack:
Python & Go
MongoDB, Redis, Apache Kafka
Kubernetes (GKE)
Various Google Cloud Platform services (Pub/Sub, BigTable, DataFlow, ...)
Gitlab CI/CD, Prometheus and Grafana

What we expect of the candidate:

The ideal candidate has:
At least 3 year experience developing in Python or Golang
Designing and implementing production-grade REST APIs
Having experience with operating services in production is beneficial
A working understanding of fundamental web security principles (OWASP), Authentication and Authorization practices
Experience with database systems of different kinds (MongoDB, Redis, Apache Kafka)

Regional benefits:
Monthly lunch entitlement by up to 110€ per month
Pension scheme or Health insurance depending on region

Join us and empower our ambitious Site Reliability Engineering team as:

Site Reliability Engineer (80% - 100%) Your mission:

As a Site Reliability Engineer for our Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) service, you empower Open Systems to deploy and operate a reliable, distributed service at scale, across multiple platforms.

You will:

Work closely with engineering teams, product owners, and other stakeholders to define service operations, identify operational issues early and prevent them
Help define Service Level Objectives to assess release readiness of all services
Develop software, tooling, and processes to automate our operations
Measure and optimize system performance
Participate in incident management on-call rotation and drive root cause analysis

At Open Systems SREs are driven by improving the operations of our services, measured by the level of service that we provide to our customers, the resources that we need to operate our services, and the interest of our operational work in our Mission Control NOC. SREs work in partnership with platform and service engineering teams in different capacity—from consulting to joint engineering projects—to drive the operational improvements across the entire lifecycle of our services.

As part of your SRE responsibilities, and through the Open Systems training and courses, you will become certified as a Mission Control Engineer, providing you with knowledge in a wide area covering networking and security topics. This will give you the opportunity to visit our Mission Control NOC in Honolulu for deployments of 2 to 3 months, where travel and accommodation is also afforded to your partner and children.

Your qualifications:

You are strong in either Software Engineering or Networking and Security Operations and have an interest in developing your skills and solving problems at the intersection of both. You are motivated to learn new skills and expand your existing theoretical and practical knowledge in training programs offered by internal domain experts and team colleagues, and ideally, you bring some of the following skills to the table:

University degree in Computer Science, or equivalent professional experience
At least 2 years of SRE, software development, DevOps, or security automation
Strong conceptional understanding of scalable system design
Full ability to design, test, and release code in general-purpose languages such as Go or Python and scripting (Bash)
Familiarity with GitOps, Terraform, Kubernetes, Prometheus, as well as major clouds (Azure, AWS, GCP...)
Interpersonal skills, ability to collaborate and build trust across teams to design and deliver shared solutions

You may already have experience with the whole breadth of the SRE role already, but do not let it stop you if you do not. We also support you making a transition to SRE from a strong skillset in software engineering, DevOps, or platform engineering.

We are currently expanding our Application Platform team and we are looking for Backend Software Engineer. Is ""security"", ""curiosity"" or ""growth"" your middle name? Then you are a good fit and you can be one of us. You can work remotely or from one of our local offices. The salary starts at €3,000 based on your experience level.

About your role and the team:

The Application Platform team empowers other engineering teams to build their services effectively and with security and compliance built-in by designing, implementing, and maintaining the magic solid foundations and the core frameworks of the Bloomreach Engagement.

Examples of the initiatives driven by this team are:
Integrated zero-trust authentication and authorization management system.
Platform for collecting and processing audit logs in a distributed environment.
Notification center, which allows other teams to communicate information to customers through a single unified channel (upcoming project).

What you might like about this role:
Wide reach - we deal with teams across the company - product, security, architects, engineers, even customers.
Security perspective will be a key element of your day-to-day work
Developing Cloud Native services consumed by customers as well as other engineering teams

What your typical day might look like:

You start your day with a code review of your colleague’s tasks while sipping a cup of fresh-brewed tea or coffee, looking for any signs of problems and possible optimizations. Then you join your teammates on a quick daily standup, where you discuss what you’re currently working on and the plan for the next few days.

After the meeting, you get into “the zone” and spend a few undisturbed hours working on the new authentication framework while making sure it’s safely covered by a suite of unit tests. With a few clicks you quickly spin up a brand new instance of the system in the development cluster, deploy your change and notify the frontend engineer that it’s ready.

You grab a snack and take a little break from coding. Instead, you help a fellow backend engineer from another team figure out the best way to integrate their new service with the audit logging platform. In the meantime the frontend engineer gets back to you and confirms that all the new endpoints work as expected, so you create a merge request and ask your teammates for a code review.

To achieve that we are building a new community around Python opscode for open source applications, running on Kubernetes. We want to move all of Canonical and Ubuntu IS onto this new, open source codebase.

We are confident that we can dramatically improve the experience of running complex business operations - and then we can help our customers embrace those new techniques and products. Traditionally, IS is an inward-facing operation. We would like to transform our IS team into an extension of the product engineering capability at Canonical. Our internal workloads are in many cases the same open source workloads that our customers want to operate. This team will productise those workloads for real-time automated operations on Kubernetes.

This role is ideal for software engineers who enjoy Python, have a passion for distributed systems, and an interest in the entire Linux stack - from kernel to networking to virtualization and containers. It is a role that requires rigour in both code and customer interactions. Our engineers are technically astute open source enthusiasts who are excited about cloud computing and are ready to join a global team charged with delivering world class services to our customers.

Strong Python development skills and familiarity with Kubernetes are key requirements of this role. You'll work closely with other teams in Canonical to ensure your products operate reliably, efficiently and scale to production sized workloads for our customers looking to adopt cutting-edge technology. You will participate and be responsible for ensuring sound software architecture and follow best practices in software quality, testing and documentation.

What you'll do
Work in Python to design and deliver open source software operations code
Work across the entire Linux stack, from kernel, networking, storage, to applications
Learn to think rigorously about application and infrastructure reliability
Shape high quality open source monitoring and alerting infrastructure
Simplify open source operations for our customers and open source community
Demonstrate sound engineering design and testing principles in your code
Follow agile software development practices
Coach and develop your colleagues where you have insights
Grow a healthy, collaborative engineering culture in line with company values
Work from home with global travel once or twice a year for up to 2 weeks for events

Who you are
You love technology and working with brilliant people
You have a Bachelor's or equivalent in Computer Science, STEM or similar degree
You are experienced with Linux systems administration, package management, and operations
You have hands-on experience with at least one public cloud
You are familiar with Docker and Kubernetes
You are an excellent Python programmer and enjoy challenging projects
You understand the importance of reliable software and strive to design and code to that expectation
You are organized and want your team to deliver timely, high quality software

About Canonical

Canonical is a growing international software company that works with the open-source community to deliver Ubuntu, ""the world's best free software platform"". Our mission is to realise the potential of free software in the lives of individuals and organisations. Our services are helping individuals and businesses worldwide to reduce costs, improve efficiency and enhance security with Ubuntu.

We are proud to foster a workplace free from discrimination. Diversity of experience, perspectives, and background create a better work environment and better products. Whatever your identity we will give your application fair consideration.
