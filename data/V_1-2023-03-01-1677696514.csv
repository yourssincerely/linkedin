Ambities en Talenten

De jonge Anthony Fokker had altijd al grote plannen, en is zijn nalatenschap nooit verloren. Want het aanpakken van grote uitdagingen ligt nu nog steeds geheel in lijn met de huidige uitdagingen. Zo ook op het gebied van duurzaamheid. Momenteel werken we aan een emissievrij regionaal vliegtuig voor 48 passagiers. Het vliegtuig vliegt dan met nul CO2-emissies en nul NOx-emissies. Met als enige bijproduct: water. Dus we staan als Fokker | GKN Aerospace niet aan de zijlijn van de huidige transities, maar we maken het ook echt werkelijkheid. Hier zitten de talenten met de juiste vaardigheden en passie voor hun vak die bezig zijn met de hoogste kwaliteitseisen.

Our mission is to reinvent the way companies manage their open source information systems - on public clouds and in their own data centres. To achieve that we are building a new community around Python opscode for open source applications, running on Kubernetes. We want to move all of Canonical and Ubuntu IS onto this new, open source codebase.

We are confident that we can dramatically improve the experience of running complex business operations - and then we can help our customers embrace those new techniques and products.

Strong Python development skills and familiarity with Kubernetes are key requirements of this role. You'll work closely with other teams in Canonical to ensure your products operate reliably, efficiently and scale to production sized workloads for our customers looking to adopt cutting-edge technology. You will participate and be responsible for ensuring sound software architecture and follow best practices in software quality, testing and documentation.

What you'll do
Work in Python to design and deliver open source software operations code
Work across the entire Linux stack, from kernel, networking, storage, to applications
Learn to think rigorously about application and infrastructure reliability
Shape high quality open source monitoring and alerting infrastructure
Simplify open source operations for our customers and open source community
Demonstrate sound engineering design and testing principles in your code
Follow agile software development practices
Coach and develop your colleagues where you have insights
Grow a healthy, collaborative engineering culture in line with company values
Work from home with global travel once or twice a year for up to 2 weeks for events

Who you are
You love technology and working with brilliant people
You have a Bachelor's or equivalent in Computer Science, STEM or similar degree
You are experienced with Linux systems administration, package management, and operations
You have hands-on experience with at least one public cloud
You are familiar with Docker and Kubernetes
You are an excellent Python programmer and enjoy challenging projects
You understand the importance of reliable software and strive to design and code to that expectation
You are organized and want your team to deliver timely, high quality software

About Canonical

Canonical is a growing international software company that works with the open-source community to deliver Ubuntu, ""the world's best free software platform"". Our mission is to realise the potential of free software in the lives of individuals and organisations.

About Hydra

Hydra is the modern data warehouse built on Postgres. Our goal is to deliver the familiar Postgres syntax, tools, and ecosystem developers love, but with the performance and scalability of other commercially available data warehouses. We believe that providing developers with familiar tools, empowers them to deliver stronger internal apps faster.

Hydra is a startup, which means you will be a huge part of shaping our future. You will have a significant impact on designing the features we build to support and add value for our customers. Hydra is committed to releasing open source products and contributing back to existing projects.

Hydra’s software expands the storage and compute capabilities of Postgres. You will contribute to new and existing open source projects and add new capabilities to Hydra.

Why we need you

We are the open-source alternative to traditional data warehouses. While there are many existing open-source projects to jump start Hydra, there are gaps. We want to deliver the complete, feature-rich experience data warehouse users expect. As we come across product ""whitespace"" we’ll build the best-in-class toolkit, dog-food it, and contribute back to the Postgres community.

What You’ll Achieve

You will be expected to make progress towards identified priorities each week that support engineering or product goals. Some examples might include:

Improving an existing open source foreign data wrapper
Improve performance or functionality in C or Rust (or both!)
Integrate with and leverage other open source software and libraries
Contribute to the design of the next version of Hydra

5 or more years of experience as a software engineer using a systems language such as C, C++, or Rust
Experience creating or modifying database systems, like Postgres or MySQL
Bachelors in Computer Science or a related field

Bonus points for:
Working on Postgres or a Postgres extension
Passion about Postgres, databases, data warehouses, developer experience, or open source
Development experience with multiple programming languages

If you don’t meet the recommended criteria, we’re open to hearing from you. We prioritize candidates who demonstrate an appetite to learn and past evidence of growth.

Why you will love it here
Pioneering spirit: To have a pioneering spirit isn’t to be fearless, but to accept challenges, take ownership, test hypotheses, and learn how to advance forward. The pioneering spirit means you’ll have a good time building and pushing frontiers.
Open to new ideas: Flexibility is critical to your personal growth and to Hydra’s success. When you believe Hydra can improve in any avenue, we require you speak up. We strive to ensure the loudest voice doesn’t win in our culture. New, diverse perspectives enable us, they don’t defeat us.
Personal and professional kindness: It is easy to say, but can be difficult to do under pressure. We assume positive intent and hold ourselves to a productive, collegial environment.

Compensation And Benefits
Competitive cash compensation, significant equity, and fully-paid health care (50% for dependents)
Full suite of US benefits
PPO, HMO, or HDHP health plan
Dental
Vision
Life and disability insurance
25 days paid PTO

Position Overview

Our customers are at the forefront of some of the most interesting data in the world, using SingleStore to push the boundaries every day. To do this well, they leverage the expertise of our Support Engineering Team, composed of technical subject matter experts on the frontlines of critical customer issues.

This Support Engineering role skews far more towards engineering than typical technical support as you will need to delve into database internals and memory allocators, diagnose complex SQL query behavior, and investigate Linux and Kubernetes related configurations, all in the name of resolving complex product issues. Our Support Engineers are constantly learning a wide range of customer systems and technical concepts and are thrilled by the new and exciting challenges that they encounter each day.

To accurately identify the source and solution of an issue, this team will take the time to learn about the customer’s business and systems while helping to improve their fundamental SingleStore and database operational knowledge. This often requires additional research and time spent on learning new technologies and tools outside of just the database engine while also being deeply engaged with multiple departments including development teams, query performance engineering, product management, infrastructure SREs, etc.

Role And Responsibilities

Provide product support to our on-premise and cloud hosted enterprise customers, acting as the first-line-of-defense for complex technical issues, bug diagnosis, or resolving critical outages.
Identify and reproduce product issues and submit formal bug reports or feature requests to the appropriate Engineering team.
Understand and help to improve complex SQL behavior to diagnose bugs or improve performance.
Collaborate with software developers, sales engineers, and technical account managers to keep all teams up to date with current issues a customer may be facing.
Work to streamline and improve various Support and Engineering processes and tools, author new knowledge base articles and run-books, and help the team continually improve efficiency and effectiveness.
Participate in our on-call rotation that may include weekends and holidays.

Required Skills And Experience

4+ years of previous customer-facing advanced technical support experience.
Previous experience as a DBA or Support Engineer at a database company.
Experience with SQL databases and advanced SQL query optimization and tuning. You should be familiar enough with at least one commercial or open source database to decipher its EXPLAIN plan and understand potential performance impact or ways to improve the query.
Strong background in general product troubleshooting, keeping in mind that query processing issues can be impacted by database or linux configuration and resource availability.
A solid linux performance background. That means you are hands-on with Linux and your skills include generating and reading flame graphs, checking system resource utilization, and parsing verbose log files. Bonus points for familiarity with Kubernetes.
Experience with a scripting or coding language. Whether it’s C++, Python, Go, or Bash, you should have a go-to solution for quick problem-solving and be able to navigate through our extensive code base.
Familiarity with distributed systems and AWS/GCP. You understand how organizations deploy and maintain distributed applications and services across multiple machines and know how to analyze these systems for performance bottlenecks.
Experience improving support processes regarding ticket triage, escalation, and reporting business metrics back to the organization.
Strong written and verbal English communication skills. Have the ability to explain technical concepts to a wide range of end-users.

SingleStore is one platform for all data, built so you can engage with insight in every moment. Trusted by industry leaders, SingleStore enables enterprises to adapt to change as it happens, embrace diverse data with ease, and accelerate the pace of innovation. SingleStore is venture-backed and headquartered in San Francisco with offices in Portland, Seattle, Boston, Bangalore, London, Lisbon, and Kyiv. Defining the future starts with The Database of Now™.

Consistent with our commitment to diversity & inclusion, we value individuals with the ability to work on diverse teams and with a diverse range of people.

To all recruitment agencies: SingleStore does not accept agency resumes. Please do not forward resumes to SingleStore employees. SingleStore is not responsible for any fees related to unsolicited resumes and will not pay fees to any third-party agency or company that does not have a signed agreement with the Company.

Description

Backend Software Engineer

We’re looking for talented, friendly and experienced Software Engineers to help build our suite of customer facing products. Here in the Treatwell tech team we’re a nice bunch, we love to ship software and we like to think we’re pretty smart. We believe in Agile principles and values, our teams typically use Kanban and various XP practices, we love DDD and are using an event driven architecture to further decouple our applications and increase resilience.

You will also help your teammates to become more effective and grow their skills.

We do things well, but we’re not complacent. We want to do great work and to be known for it. We are breaking up our applications into microservices that are well tested, independently deployable and highly observable. We are empowering our teams to operate independently and to ship to production as frequently as they see fit. We’re looking for people who can help us to realise this vision and accelerate the journey, who know what great technology looks like and who can mentor our existing team.

About You
You’ve written Java professionally.
You’ve worked with some of our tech stack and can learn the rest very quickly.
You’ve been part of a high-performing, autonomous Agile development team who deliver continuously.
You get a kick out of mentoring and empowering the team around you.
You have a deep understanding of how distributed applications are designed and built.
You know good technical design when you see it and how to ensure quality is embedded in the software development process.
You’re a good communicator, fun to work with and enjoy being part of a vocal, passionate team.
You’re active in the software development community, whether through blogs, meetups, personal projects or open source contributions.

Site Reliability Engineer (80% - 100%) Your mission:

As a Site Reliability Engineer for our Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) service, you empower Open Systems to deploy and operate a reliable, distributed service at scale, across multiple platforms.

You will:

Work closely with engineering teams, product owners, and other stakeholders to define service operations, identify operational issues early and prevent them
Help define Service Level Objectives to assess release readiness of all services
Develop software, tooling, and processes to automate our operations
Measure and optimize system performance
Participate in incident management on-call rotation and drive root cause analysis

At Open Systems SREs are driven by improving the operations of our services, measured by the level of service that we provide to our customers, the resources that we need to operate our services, and the interest of our operational work in our Mission Control NOC. SREs work in partnership with platform and service engineering teams in different capacity—from consulting to joint engineering projects—to drive the operational improvements across the entire lifecycle of our services.

As part of your SRE responsibilities, and through the Open Systems training and courses, you will become certified as a Mission Control Engineer, providing you with knowledge in a wide area covering networking and security topics. This will give you the opportunity to visit our Mission Control NOC in Honolulu for deployments of 2 to 3 months, where travel and accommodation is also afforded to your partner and children.

Your qualifications:

University degree in Computer Science, or equivalent professional experience
At least 2 years of SRE, software development, DevOps, or security automation
Strong conceptional understanding of scalable system design
Full ability to design, test, and release code in general-purpose languages such as Go or Python and scripting (Bash)
Familiarity with GitOps, Terraform, Kubernetes, Prometheus, as well as major clouds (Azure, AWS, GCP...)
Interpersonal skills, ability to collaborate and build trust across teams to design and deliver shared solutions

You may already have experience with the whole breadth of the SRE role already, but do not let it stop you if you do not. We also support you making a transition to SRE from a strong skillset in software engineering, DevOps, or platform engineering. In that case you should be able to explain why would want to make this transition.

What we offer:

You will join our growing SRE team, and work with agile method in coordination with software and product engineering teams. You will have the opportunity to work remotely from Switzerland, Germany, Austria, the Netherlands, or the United States, or be based in one of our offices in Zürich, Bern, Düsseldorf, Vienna or Redwood City. You will have the option to work full-time or part-time 80%.

Open Systems will offer you interesting challenges in the dynamic and global environment of SD-WAN and cybersecurity. You will be in a work environment in which innovative solutions, rapid development times, creativity, and open communication are practiced and continuously fostered. The pursuit of technical advancement is at the center of our attention. Our employees are known as enthusiastic, humorous, and passionate individuals. It’s all about people because it’s them who make us stand out in the marketplace, not our technology.

We look forward to receiving your online application (please note that you have to compress your application into two attachments). For further questions and inquiries about applications, please feel free to contact Martin Blecher at +41 58 100 10 10. Only direct applications will be considered.

If you’re reading this, you’re probably applying for/considering applying for a job with us, and we want you to know that Bullhorn is an equal opportunity employer. For us, that means we always have, and will always, strive to be as inclusive as possible in all aspects of employment and that we do not and will not tolerate discrimination of any kind."

Our mission is to reinvent the way companies manage their open source information systems - on public clouds and in their own data centres. To achieve that we are building a new community around Python opscode for open source applications, running on Kubernetes. We want to move all of Canonical and Ubuntu IS onto this new, open source codebase.

We are confident that we can dramatically improve the experience of running complex business operations - and then we can help our customers embrace those new techniques and products. Traditionally, IS is an inward-facing operation. We would like to transform our IS team into an extension of the product engineering capability at Canonical.

Follow agile software development practices
Coach and develop your colleagues where you have insights
Grow a healthy, collaborative engineering culture in line with company values
Work from home with global travel once or twice a year for up to 2 weeks for events

Who you are
You love technology and working with brilliant people
You have a Bachelor's or equivalent in Computer Science, STEM or similar degree
You are experienced with Linux systems administration, package management, and operations
You have hands-on experience with at least one public cloud
You are familiar with Docker and Kubernetes
You are an excellent Python programmer and enjoy challenging projects
You understand the importance of reliable software and strive to design and code to that expectation
You are organized and want your team to deliver timely, high quality software

As part of your SRE responsibilities, and through the Open Systems training and courses, you will become certified as a Mission Control Engineer, providing you with knowledge in a wide area covering networking and security topics.

How do you know if you want to work at InnovationCast?

You seek to learn and want to grow personally and professionally. The real magic of innovation happens when committed people work smarter to turn ideas into new value. If we don’t become better at what we do, we won’t help our customers do the same. So if you value repetition more than discovery, this job is not for you.

You want to do work that matters for people who care. We’re a startup working to solve a big and relevant problem - one that won’t go away. Helping our customers to get better results through innovation management is - and will ever be - a work in progress. But it is so important and makes a difference for so many people, that the mission inspires you.

You welcome change and actually like to drive it. We strive to give our customers the best tools so they can keep making progress with innovation. This means that we have to experiment a lot with new ideas. As expected, some of them will work, others won’t. You need to be willing to be wrong, not afraid to make mistakes and actively learn from the process.

You don’t want to be micromanaged and want to bring actionable ideas to the team. Innovation is a team sport. Sometimes your work will seem tricky and confusing because you will be working on something that doesn’t exist yet. You will reflect on and understand our thinking and be humble to ask for help, and share difficulties and potential ways forward. But you don’t expect to be given a checklist. When you feel others may be wrong, you speak up and explain your point of view. You value honest communication.

You believe innovation and entrepreneurship can help companies change the way they work and how business is done. You may even want to become an entrepreneur. We’re set to use innovation management and entrepreneurship practices to provide software that helps companies think and act differently at scale. By opening innovation to employees, customers and partners, organizations can explore unforeseen possibilities and make real progress they couldn’t do on their own.

About InnovationCast

We’re a rapidly growing startup with an excellent SaaS product used by top brands globally. And we are on a mission to change the way organizations innovate: for better and for good. Want to join us?

InnovationCast is the collaborative innovation management software (SaaS) that helps organizations discover, incubate, and accelerate ideas. In short, we connect people and ideas and enable them to bring the best ideas to life and make a difference.

We have fantastic customers like DHL, Mayo Clinic, or Delta. We’re backed by Indico Capital, Shilling Capital and accelerated by Google for Startups.

We make innovation simpler, faster, more productive, and even fun. We believe that innovation and entrepreneurship mindsets and practices will become part of how people work daily. And we are set to make it possible and accessible for companies of all shapes and sizes.

Would you like to join a growing team and have an impact on the development of a world-class product?

Our mission is to reinvent the way companies manage their open source information systems - on public clouds and in their own data centres. To achieve that we are building a new community around Python opscode for open source applications, running on Kubernetes. We want to move all of Canonical and Ubuntu IS onto this new, open source codebase.

We are confident that we can dramatically improve the experience of running complex business operations - and then we can help our customers embrace those new techniques and products. Traditionally, IS is an inward-facing operation. We would like to transform our IS team into an extension of the product engineering capability at Canonical. Our internal workloads are in many cases the same open source workloads that our customers want to operate. This team will productise those workloads for real-time automated operations on Kubernetes.

This role is ideal for software engineers who enjoy Python, have a passion for distributed systems, and an interest in the entire Linux stack - from kernel to networking to virtualization and containers. It is a role that requires rigour in both code and customer interactions. Our engineers are technically astute open source enthusiasts who are excited about cloud computing and are ready to join a global team charged with delivering world class services to our customers.

Strong Python development skills and familiarity with Kubernetes are key requirements of this role. You'll work closely with other teams in Canonical to ensure your products operate reliably, efficiently and scale to production sized workloads for our customers looking to adopt cutting-edge technology. You will participate and be responsible for ensuring sound software architecture and follow best practices in software quality, testing and documentation.

What you'll do
Work in Python to design and deliver open source software operations code
Work across the entire Linux stack, from kernel, networking, storage, to applications
Learn to think rigorously about application and infrastructure reliability
Shape high quality open source monitoring and alerting infrastructure
Simplify open source operations for our customers and open source community
Demonstrate sound engineering design and testing principles in your code
Follow agile software development practices
Coach and develop your colleagues where you have insights
Grow a healthy, collaborative engineering culture in line with company values
Work from home with global travel once or twice a year for up to 2 weeks for events

Who you are
You love technology and working with brilliant people
You have a Bachelor's or equivalent in Computer Science, STEM or similar degree
You are experienced with Linux systems administration, package management, and operations
You have hands-on experience with at least one public cloud
You are familiar with Docker and Kubernetes
You are an excellent Python programmer and enjoy challenging projects
You understand the importance of reliable software and strive to design and code to that expectation
You are organized and want your team to deliver timely, high quality software

About Canonical

Canonical is a growing international software company that works with the open-source community to deliver Ubuntu, ""the world's best free software platform"". Our mission is to realise the potential of free software in the lives of individuals and organisations. Our services are helping individuals and businesses worldwide to reduce costs, improve efficiency and enhance security with Ubuntu.

We are proud to foster a workplace free from discrimination. Diversity of experience, perspectives, and background create a better work environment and better products. Whatever your identity we will give your application fair consideration.

You will be part of a team focused on performance, as illustrated in this article by Florian, our Director of Web.

Our web apps all use a state-of-the-art version of the Ember.js framework . You can read why in this article by Frédéric, Senior Lead on the team.

We have released several open-source JavaScript libraries and our team members regularly speak at conferences such as EmberConf and EmberFest.

Bloomreach is the world’s #1 Commerce Experience Cloud, empowering brands to deliver customer journeys so personalized, they feel like magic. It offers a suite of products that drive true personalization and digital commerce growth, including:
Discovery, offering AI-driven search and merchandising
Content, offering a headless CMS
Engagement, offering a leading CDP and marketing automation solutions

Together, these solutions combine the power of unified customer and product data with the speed and scale of AI optimization, enabling revenue-driving digital commerce experiences that convert on any channel and every journey. Bloomreach serves over 850 global brands including Albertsons, Bosch, Puma, FC Bayern München, and Marks & Spencer. Bloomreach recently raised $175 million in a Series F funding round, bringing its total valuation to $2.2 billion. The investment was led by Goldman Sachs Asset Management with participation from Bain Capital Ventures and Sixth Street Growth. For more information, visit Bloomreach.com.

We are currently expanding our Application Platform team and we are looking for Backend Software Engineer. Is ""security"", ""curiosity"" or ""growth"" your middle name? Then you are a good fit and you can be one of us. You can work remotely or from one of our local offices. The salary starts at €3,000 based on your experience level.

About your role and the team:

The Application Platform team empowers other engineering teams to build their services effectively and with security and compliance built-in by designing, implementing, and maintaining the magic solid foundations and the core frameworks of the Bloomreach Engagement.

Examples of the initiatives driven by this team are:
Integrated zero-trust authentication and authorization management system.
Platform for collecting and processing audit logs in a distributed environment.
Notification center, which allows other teams to communicate information to customers through a single unified channel (upcoming project).

What you might like about this role:
Wide reach - we deal with teams across the company - product, security, architects, engineers, even customers.
Security perspective will be a key element of your day-to-day work
Developing Cloud Native services consumed by customers as well as other engineering teams

What your typical day might look like:

You start your day with a code review of your colleague’s tasks while sipping a cup of fresh-brewed tea or coffee, looking for any signs of problems and possible optimizations. Then you join your teammates on a quick daily standup, where you discuss what you’re currently working on and the plan for the next few days.

After the meeting, you get into “the zone” and spend a few undisturbed hours working on the new authentication framework while making sure it’s safely covered by a suite of unit tests. With a few clicks you quickly spin up a brand new instance of the system in the development cluster, deploy your change and notify the frontend engineer that it’s ready.

You grab a snack and take a little break from coding. Instead, you help a fellow backend engineer from another team figure out the best way to integrate their new service with the audit logging platform. In the meantime the frontend engineer gets back to you and confirms that all the new endpoints work as expected, so you create a merge request and ask your teammates for a code review. It’s a complex piece of code, so you go through it together.

After your code is approved, you merge it, automatically deploying it to the staging environment where it receives further testing by the QA team and automated integration tests before being released to production.

You end your day in a short meeting with a product manager and the director of engineering, where you flesh out the idea you had over lunch yesterday for a new approach to release management that would make the whole process even faster.

Our tech stack:
Python & Go
MongoDB, Redis, Apache Kafka
Kubernetes (GKE)
Various Google Cloud Platform services (Pub/Sub, BigTable, DataFlow, ...)
Gitlab CI/CD, Prometheus and Grafana

What we expect of the candidate:

The ideal candidate has:
At least 3 year experience developing in Python or Golang
Designing and implementing production-grade REST APIs
Having experience with operating services in production is beneficial
A working understanding of fundamental web security principles (OWASP), Authentication and Authorization practices
Experience with database systems of different kinds (MongoDB, Redis, Apache Kafka)

Regional benefits:
Monthly lunch entitlement by up to 110€ per month
Pension scheme or Health insurance depending on region

At Jamf, we empower people to be their best selves and do their best work. You will join a unit of Cloud Engineers that contribute to Jamf Security portfolio. Some of us work from one of our offices - Brno, Emmen and London - and others are partially or fully remote. We deploy our solutions on the best cloud providers - AWS, GCP and Azure. Our infrastructure is declared with Terraform and configured with Puppet. We build and maintain over 20 K8s and K3s clusters all around the world with Rancher at the helm of it.

If Data is the new gold and you are the King of Data… what does that make you? Not sure, but you are certainly a DBA! And if you are the type of DBA that is not married to a particular technology, likes to get his hands dirty and is interested in everything related to databases then you might be what we are looking for to scale our DBA team.

What we need from you:

The DBA Team owns many core database clusters in Production as well several other instances on a wide range of technologies. You will work alongside the rest of our DBAs in a small and agile team that owns their direction of travel.

Your primary focus will be scalability, integrity, performance, availability, security, monitoring and troubleshooting of our core DB clusters, exploring new ways of consolidating data sources and making more data available to more people at Jamf and last but not least supporting our Dev Teams as they build the new features that will shape the future of Jamf.

And if you are not scared of doing some coding, you can get involved in how we build and monitor our DBs, using technologies like Terraform and Prometheus.

Some of the traits we expect from you:
No challenge is too big or too small for you. You get excited at the prospect of a complex project and at the same time you understand that small improvements can sometimes make a massive difference.
You hold yourself and your team to a high standard when working in production.
You have some cloud experience, ideally with AWS.
You have experience with at least 2 different DB technologies as well as awesome SQL skills and ideally NoSQL as well. We use Dremio, Vertica, Mongo as well as other technologies. But we won’t frown upon you if Oracle is your cup of tea.
Exposure with Big Data and column based datastore technologies will be a nice bonus point.

Why will you love it here? ❤️

Headquartered in New York City, Dataiku was founded in Paris in 2013 and achieved unicorn status in 2019. Now, more than 1,000+ employees work across the globe in our offices and remotely. Backed by a renowned set of investors and partners including CapitalG, Tiger Global, and ICONIQ Growth, we’ve set out to build the future of AI.

Data visualization is often the most striking (and for some, the most accessible) part of the data-to-insights process. Let’s face it — there’s nothing more exciting than beautiful fit-for-purpose data viz.

We are looking for a talented software engineer to create usable, intuitive, beautiful interfaces and scalable engines for Dataiku DSS. Dataiku DSS brings together big data and AI technologies into a unique and easy-to-use platform. It allows data scientists to process data with SQL databases, Spark, and Kubernetes with either user-friendly interfaces or code. The same platform also allows business analysts to create powerful machines or deep learning models with just a few clicks.

What We Do

We design and code experiences that resonate with our growing customer base. We empower non-technical users with user-friendly and well-thought tools to let them quickly and efficiently visualize, analyze, or process their data. Our current technical stack is based on Javascript, AngularJS, Angular, and D3.js on the frontend (we only support the latest versions of Chrome and Firefox!). We develop using Java, Spring, and Python on the backend.

What You Will Do

With your top-tier teammates from the engineering team and the help of the UX team, you will:

Build the components that allow Dataiku DSS users to create and display charts, dashboards, and ad-hoc web applications in a scalable way (both frontend and backend).
Prototype and create new ways to interact with data or integrations with other products such as Tableau, PowerBI, Salesforce, Slack, etc.
Work closely with product managers and UX designers to brainstorm on new features and iteratively refine solutions.
Shape a safe place to work where all ideas and suggestions are welcome and taken into account, and where we all know everyone does their best.
Write high-quality code, as your teammates do!
You are the ideal recruit if:

You have experience in software development and you are interested in data visualization tools.
You are customer-oriented — you want to understand customer needs and how the product is used.
You are at ease with both frontend and backend development, or you’ve mastered frontend development but are not afraid to dive into backend code to better understand how it works.
You know that a chart is worth a thousand grid cells.
You have firsthand experience (either professional or personal) building a real product.
You blink each time you see a misaligned pixel!
You are humble and kind. You don't hesitate to ask questions when you don't know, and you treat your colleagues with respect, kindness, and honesty.
Dataiku’s culture is right for you if:

You want to be able to define your own version of work-life balance - flexible is our go-to word, it applies equally to remote work, vacations and parental benefits
You need autonomy to thrive - we trust our people, give them space to do their best and stay away from artificial deadlines
You enjoy spending time with your colleagues and learning from your peers - meet for Friday universities, annual offsites, virtual trivia nights and more
You like feeling cared about - watch out for the magical Christmas box delivered at home and an unforgettable onboarding week
You care about giving back - it’s what our Ikig.AI program is all about: Dataikers are encouraged to work pro bono for one or several nonprofits of their choosing

We’re VaynerMedia! We are a contemporary global creative and media agency built for the now.

Culture is our key and Empathy is how we build it. VaynerMedia EMEA is strong with a world-class combination of diverse backgrounds collaborating to put forward innovative, creative and strategic solutions to the one advantage that stands the test of time – PEOPLE. Day in and day out, we propel some of the biggest brands in the world to the intersection of attention and culture. In EMEA, we are proudly 250+, servicing multi-brands across the region.

The PITCH.
VaynerMedia EMEA is searching for a motivated, and highly organised person to join the Creative Team as a Lead Creator.
Looking to make the move and step up into a senior role or already acing it and getting itchy feet for more ideas that see the light of day? Then this could be for you.
Here’s where you come in…
We're looking for a senior creative to add to the creative firepower of our creative department, working across any of our clients. You'll be the go-to creative, known for nailing briefs big or small and your book will be bursting with ideas that show it. Great with more junior members of the team and clients alike - always pushing for the best work possible. From slick idea decks to initial design - you’re unafraid to roll your sleeves up, you know how to turn pitch-winning concepts into actual campaigns and love every step of the way.
Concepting and creating great ideas that hit the client briefs and make us all proud. Adept at presenting, you can work alongside your CD and client partnership teams to build and grow clients. You're used to creating the best ideas possible under pressure and making things happen - always with grace and good humour. You love the thought of challenging the advertising industry, embracing change and be a keen adopter of new strategies and techniques
We treasure Personality and Experience yet we do know that these qualifications lead to what WE KNOW as a success:
Ideas, ideas, ideas – your folio will be chocked full of recent work that has made it into the world and made a difference for the brand, for the audience, for the awards shelf...
All around creator who write, designs and copy top notch contents across different platforms.
The hunger and ability to create spot-on ideas from concept to completion - own and love the ideas you create
Able to spot the seed of an idea and understand how to nurture and enable it to grow into an impactful, change-making campaign
A talent for working across multiple projects and switching easily when needed.
Strong hands-on knowledge of the big social media platforms and their specific abilities/limitations. You play on the platforms and understand their differences.
You play well with others and love how ideas can grow, embracing the skills other creatives bring to the final results.
Works well with others and love how ideas can grow, embracing the skills other creatives bring to the final results.
Excellent written and verbal communication skills in English and French
What you SHOULD KNOW about VaynerMedia
Think “lab” and not “agency”. We get excited about solving business problems, not creating advertising for the sake of making advertising. Our entrepreneurship DNA runs deep. We’re willing to break rules, try new things, and test hypotheses if it means better understanding our craft. It’s fun!
We believe 100% that brands can be built on digital platforms and part of our model is built bottom up, flipping the traditional advertising model and process on its head. We don’t play to agency/industry norms and our culture and energy reflects that.
Our environment (and pace) feels much more like a start-up than most agencies you might be used to. Hopefully that, and the opportunity to collaborate with the talented and enthusiastic crew, work with big brands excites you, as it does us. We can’t wait to meet you.

Cloudflare protects and accelerates any Internet application online without adding hardware, installing software, or changing a line of code.

What Makes Cloudflare Special?

We’re not just a highly ambitious, large-scale technology company. We’re a highly ambitious, large-scale technology company with a soul. Fundamental to our mission to help build a better Internet is protecting the free and open Internet.

Project Galileo : We equip politically and artistically important organizations and journalists with powerful tools to defend themselves against attacks that would otherwise censor their work, technology already used by Cloudflare’s enterprise customers--at no cost.

Athenian Project : We created Athenian Project to ensure that state and local governments have the highest level of protection and reliability for free, so that their constituents have access to election information and voter registration.

Path Forward Partnership : Since 2016, we have partnered with Path Forward, a nonprofit organization, to create 16-week positions for mid-career professionals who want to get back to the workplace after taking time off to care for a child, parent, or loved one.

1.1.1.1 : We released 1.1.1.1 to help fix the foundation of the Internet by building a faster, more secure and privacy-centric public DNS resolver. This is available publicly for everyone to use - it is the first consumer-focused service Cloudflare has ever released. Here’s the deal - we don’t store client IP addresses never, ever. We will continue to abide by our privacy commitment and ensure that no user data is sold to advertisers or used to target consumers.

You will also work with other teams to ensure our decisions improve the overall performance and experience of Ubuntu. As a member of the Ubuntu Foundations team, your work will have an impact on every aspect of the Ubuntu ecosystem from Desktop to Server, Ubuntu Core, containers and also cloud images.

Position Overview

Our customers are at the forefront of some of the most interesting data in the world, using SingleStore to push the boundaries every day. To do this well, they leverage the expertise of our Support Engineering Team, composed of technical subject matter experts on the frontlines of critical customer issues.

This Support Engineering role skews far more towards engineering than typical technical support as you will need to delve into database internals and memory allocators, diagnose complex SQL query behavior, and investigate Linux and Kubernetes related configurations, all in the name of resolving complex product issues. Our Support Engineers are constantly learning a wide range of customer systems and technical concepts and are thrilled by the new and exciting challenges that they encounter each day.

To accurately identify the source and solution of an issue, this team will take the time to learn about the customer’s business and systems while helping to improve their fundamental SingleStore and database operational knowledge. This often requires additional research and time spent on learning new technologies and tools outside of just the database engine while also being deeply engaged with multiple departments including development teams, query performance engineering, product management, infrastructure SREs, etc.

Role And Responsibilities

Provide product support to our on-premise and cloud hosted enterprise customers, acting as the first-line-of-defense for complex technical issues, bug diagnosis, or resolving critical outages.
Identify and reproduce product issues and submit formal bug reports or feature requests to the appropriate Engineering team.
Understand and help to improve complex SQL behavior to diagnose bugs or improve performance.
Collaborate with software developers, sales engineers, and technical account managers to keep all teams up to date with current issues a customer may be facing.
Work to streamline and improve various Support and Engineering processes and tools, author new knowledge base articles and run-books, and help the team continually improve efficiency and effectiveness.
Participate in our on-call rotation that may include weekends and holidays.

Required Skills And Experience

4+ years of previous customer-facing advanced technical support experience.
Previous experience as a DBA or Support Engineer at a database company.
Experience with SQL databases and advanced SQL query optimization and tuning. You should be familiar enough with at least one commercial or open source database to decipher its EXPLAIN plan and understand potential performance impact or ways to improve the query.
Strong background in general product troubleshooting, keeping in mind that query processing issues can be impacted by database or linux configuration and resource availability.
A solid linux performance background. That means you are hands-on with Linux and your skills include generating and reading flame graphs, checking system resource utilization, and parsing verbose log files. Bonus points for familiarity with Kubernetes.
Experience with a scripting or coding language. Whether it’s C++, Python, Go, or Bash, you should have a go-to solution for quick problem-solving and be able to navigate through our extensive code base.
Familiarity with distributed systems and AWS/GCP. You understand how organizations deploy and maintain distributed applications and services across multiple machines and know how to analyze these systems for performance bottlenecks.
Experience improving support processes regarding ticket triage, escalation, and reporting business metrics back to the organization.
Strong written and verbal English communication skills. Have the ability to explain technical concepts to a wide range of end-users.

SingleStore is one platform for all data, built so you can engage with insight in every moment. Trusted by industry leaders, SingleStore enables enterprises to adapt to change as it happens, embrace diverse data with ease, and accelerate the pace of innovation. SingleStore is venture-backed and headquartered in San Francisco with offices in Portland, Seattle, Boston, Bangalore, London, Lisbon, and Kyiv. Defining the future starts with The Database of Now™.

Consistent with our commitment to diversity & inclusion, we value individuals with the ability to work on diverse teams and with a diverse range of people.

To all recruitment agencies: SingleStore does not accept agency resumes. Please do not forward resumes to SingleStore employees. SingleStore is not responsible for any fees related to unsolicited resumes and will not pay fees to any third-party agency or company that does not have a signed agreement with the Company.

Bloomreach is the world’s #1 Commerce Experience Cloud, empowering brands to deliver customer journeys so personalized, they feel like magic. It offers a suite of products that drive true personalization and digital commerce growth, including:
Discovery, offering AI-driven search and merchandising
Content, offering a headless CMS
Engagement, offering a leading CDP and marketing automation solutions

Together, these solutions combine the power of unified customer and product data with the speed and scale of AI optimization, enabling revenue-driving digital commerce experiences that convert on any channel and every journey. Bloomreach serves over 850 global brands including Albertsons, Bosch, Puma, FC Bayern München, and Marks & Spencer. Bloomreach recently raised $175 million in a Series F funding round, bringing its total valuation to $2.2 billion. The investment was led by Goldman Sachs Asset Management with participation from Bain Capital Ventures and Sixth Street Growth. For more information, visit Bloomreach.com.

We are currently expanding our Application Platform team and we are looking for Backend Software Engineer. Is ""security"", ""curiosity"" or ""growth"" your middle name? Then you are a good fit and you can be one of us. You can work remotely or from one of our local offices. The salary starts at €3,000 based on your experience level.

About your role and the team:

The Application Platform team empowers other engineering teams to build their services effectively and with security and compliance built-in by designing, implementing, and maintaining the magic solid foundations and the core frameworks of the Bloomreach Engagement.

Examples of the initiatives driven by this team are:
Integrated zero-trust authentication and authorization management system.
Platform for collecting and processing audit logs in a distributed environment.
Notification center, which allows other teams to communicate information to customers through a single unified channel (upcoming project).

What you might like about this role:
Wide reach - we deal with teams across the company - product, security, architects, engineers, even customers.
Security perspective will be a key element of your day-to-day work
Developing Cloud Native services consumed by customers as well as other engineering teams

What your typical day might look like:

You start your day with a code review of your colleague’s tasks while sipping a cup of fresh-brewed tea or coffee, looking for any signs of problems and possible optimizations. Then you join your teammates on a quick daily standup, where you discuss what you’re currently working on and the plan for the next few days.

After the meeting, you get into “the zone” and spend a few undisturbed hours working on the new authentication framework while making sure it’s safely covered by a suite of unit tests. With a few clicks you quickly spin up a brand new instance of the system in the development cluster, deploy your change and notify the frontend engineer that it’s ready.

You grab a snack and take a little break from coding. Instead, you help a fellow backend engineer from another team figure out the best way to integrate their new service with the audit logging platform. In the meantime the frontend engineer gets back to you and confirms that all the new endpoints work as expected, so you create a merge request and ask your teammates for a code review. It’s a complex piece of code, so you go through it together.

After your code is approved, you merge it, automatically deploying it to the staging environment where it receives further testing by the QA team and automated integration tests before being released to production.

You end your day in a short meeting with a product manager and the director of engineering, where you flesh out the idea you had over lunch yesterday for a new approach to release management that would make the whole process even faster.

Our tech stack:
Python & Go
MongoDB, Redis, Apache Kafka
Kubernetes (GKE)
Various Google Cloud Platform services (Pub/Sub, BigTable, DataFlow, ...)
Gitlab CI/CD, Prometheus and Grafana

What we expect of the candidate:

The ideal candidate has:
At least 3 year experience developing in Python or Golang
Designing and implementing production-grade REST APIs
Having experience with operating services in production is beneficial
A working understanding of fundamental web security principles (OWASP), Authentication and Authorization practices
Experience with database systems of different kinds (MongoDB, Redis, Apache Kafka)

Regional benefits:
Monthly lunch entitlement by up to 110€ per month
Pension scheme or Health insurance depending on region

We are on a mission to make science open so everyone can live healthy lives on a healthy planet

Who We Are

Frontiers is an award-winning open science platform and leading open access scholarly publisher.

We are one of the largest and most cited publishers globally. To date, our 200,000 freely available research articles have received more than 1 billion views and downloads and 2 million citations. Our journals span science, health, humanities and social sciences, engineering, and sustainability. And we continue to expand into new academic disciplines so more researchers can publish open access.

Be part of the publishing revolution and help us transform the way research is published, evaluated, and communicated to the world.

Who Are We Looking For

We are looking for a smart, communicative person with a dynamic mindset who is able to work independently in a highly innovative and fast-paced environment to fulfil the role of an R&D Software Engineer and expand our Publishing Operations – Core Architecture team.

We believe that the right person should have a natural curiosity to learn new things and should be happy to share the knowledge and act as a trainer when needed.

Strong development background with an inclination towards good development practices, good knowledge of Object-Oriented Programming, SOLID principles, design patterns will be most important.

What You Will Do/role Description
As an R&D Software Engineer with .NET, you will be working together with the Solutions Architect, other Software Engineers, Data Engineers, and others as part of the Core Architecture team within the Publishing Operations development unit.
You will research and develop cross-product components, prototypes, frameworks, or applications to support the other Product Development teams or to be used by business users.
You will also rebuild parts of our platform using Microsoft based technologies (.NET Core/C#, Azure, MSSQL) as well as open source (Hasura, PostgreSQL, Camunda, Kafka, MongoDB) and share ownership of the cross-product architecture layer.
You will work in a fast-paced environment while juggling several different tasks and initiatives simultaneously. Innovation and green-field development will become part of your daily job. You will be expected to support product teams’ developers in using your components as well as collaborating with other external teams to accomplish cross-team goals.
You will be expected to explore new technologies that you never worked with and to go outside your comfort zone, to use fast-prototyping methods to deliver your result.

We make conscientious decisions to adopt new technologies so your work will revolve around .NET, MSSQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Camunda, Azure, DevOps Server but we are also considering adopting Java or NodeJS as a part of our future stack. Our newest adoption to the tech stack is Hasura and our newest assessments are for the adoption of CloudEvents, Kafka, Camunda Cloud.

Knowledge of “clean-code” best practices, SOLID principles, and software design patterns
Experience with .NET/C# in the context of web applications and microservices architecture
Experience with any messaging platforms (RabbitMQ, Azure Service Bus, Kafka, etc.)
Experience with any relational database engines (e.g. MS SQL Server, PostgreSQL) and any non-relational database engines (e.g. MongoDB, CosmosDB, Elastic Search)
Familiarity with cloud technologies (Azure, AWS, GCP)
Basic knowledge of Docker and Kubernetes
Basic understanding of DevOps practices

Nice to have Requirements:
Experience with Event-Driven Architecture

This includes:

100% remote working

Employees now have the flexibility to choose where they want to work, with remote working available on a part- or full-time basis (not applicable to some Workplace/IT jobs due to nature of role requiring presence onsite, in the office).

Wellbeing

We offer free online yoga classes, an employee assistance plan, access to the Headspace app, and four wellbeing days on top of your annual leave allowance.

Wide reach - we deal with teams across the company - product, security, architects, engineers, even customers.
Security perspective will be a key element of your day-to-day work
Developing Cloud Native services consumed by customers as well as other engineering teams

What your typical day might look like:

You start your day with a code review of your colleague’s tasks while sipping a cup of fresh-brewed tea or coffee, looking for any signs of problems and possible optimizations. Then you join your teammates on a quick daily standup, where you discuss what you’re currently working on and the plan for the next few days.

After the meeting, you get into “the zone” and spend a few undisturbed hours working on the new authentication framework while making sure it’s safely covered by a suite of unit tests. With a few clicks you quickly spin up a brand new instance of the system in the development cluster, deploy your change and notify the frontend engineer that it’s ready.

You grab a snack and take a little break from coding. Instead, you help a fellow backend engineer from another team figure out the best way to integrate their new service with the audit logging platform. In the meantime the frontend engineer gets back to you and confirms that all the new endpoints work as expected, so you create a merge request and ask your teammates for a code review. It’s a complex piece of code, so you go through it together.

After your code is approved, you merge it, automatically deploying it to the staging environment where it receives further testing by the QA team and automated integration tests before being released to production.

You end your day in a short meeting with a product manager and the director of engineering, where you flesh out the idea you had over lunch yesterday for a new approach to release management that would make the whole process even faster.

Our tech stack:
Python & Go
MongoDB, Redis, Apache Kafka
Kubernetes (GKE)
Various Google Cloud Platform services (Pub/Sub, BigTable, DataFlow, ...)
Gitlab CI/CD, Prometheus and Grafana

What we expect of the candidate:

The ideal candidate has:
At least 3 year experience developing in Python or Golang
Designing and implementing production-grade REST APIs
Having experience with operating services in production is beneficial
A working understanding of fundamental web security principles (OWASP), Authentication and Authorization practices
Experience with database systems of different kinds (MongoDB, Redis, Apache Kafka)

Regional benefits:
Monthly lunch entitlement by up to 110€ per month
Pension scheme or Health insurance depending on region

Description

Our vision is clear. Arming companies with the insights to ensure every piece of software built or bought is safe. That every threat is detected, and the deployment risks are well understood. An innovative vision requires creative people to help forge this transformational journey at ReversingLabs. ReversingLabs is recognized by the cybersecurity industry as a leader in innovation. Investment from Crosspoint capital of $56M will support our growth and efforts to build scalable, automated and intelligent software security solutions.

In this day and age, with systems and people under attack day and night by highly advanced cyber threats, a swift but detailed analysis of current threats and attack vectors is necessary. Given the number of such attacks, this is no small feat. As a member of the threat detection team, your focus will be on identifying malicious threats, behaviors, components, and exposure risks (such as vulnerabilities) of various applications, and to provide actionable intelligence for our customers and community on how to improve their security posture. You will often have to put yourself in the attacker’s shoes, correlate even the tiniest clues with millions of metadata records, and try to connect the dots to completely understand the impact. Finally, to automatically identify threats and risks, you will need to transform your knowledge into a rule-based format that our analysis solutions understand, effectively shielding other potential victims.

We will guide you through the details of various file formats so you can better understand the foundation of our work. You will familiarize yourself with the way applications are structured, learn how to identify benign or malicious behavior, and how to use popular and in-house developed technologies for analysis. Working alongside industry experts, you will understand how your work ties into our overall product offering, and get feedback on the impact of your work.

Of course, we don’t expect you to be able to tackle threats right off the bat. Based on your skill level, you will undergo a specially crafted training during the first few months to sharpen your skills before entering the arena. Do you have what it takes?

Responsibilities

Keeping track of the latest cybersecurity threats
Providing timely and accurate analyses of threat capabilities
Identifying and analyzing software, and providing actionable feedback to improve security
Creating and maintaining reliable format identification, malware detection and behavior description rules
