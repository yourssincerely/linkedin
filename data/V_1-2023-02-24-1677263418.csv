Our client is looking for QA Networking Engineers with Test Automation and Python skillset, who are defining and maintaining the Quality Release Gate for our Customer.

The Customer relies on us to keep a healthy and real PASS rate of the tests in order to maintain a high-performance product and demonstrable quality metrics (Quality Gate).

Contribute to automated test case development and framework development when the QG is GREEN and/or workload need is low (e.g. between release-end - release-start) - to keep a flexible, challenging work content and thus keep people motivation levels high, as well as work efficiency.

Our Team has developed a state-of-the-art Auto Triage Framework, which uses advanced signature learning techniques to assist our Engineers in performing RCA and streamlining the Quality Gate process. Everyone has the opportunity to use and contribute to Auto Triage, a unique framework which is providing exceptional value to our Engineers and to our Customer.

Strong Python development skills and familiarity with Kubernetes are key requirements of this role. You'll work closely with other teams in Canonical to ensure your products operate reliably, efficiently and scale to production sized workloads for our customers looking to adopt cutting-edge technology. You will participate and be responsible for ensuring sound software architecture and follow best practices in software quality, testing and documentation.

Shape high quality open source monitoring and alerting infrastructure
Simplify open source operations for our customers and open source community

You are experienced with Linux systems administration, package management, and operations
You have hands-on experience with at least one public cloud
You are familiar with Docker and Kubernetes

You understand the importance of reliable software and strive to design and code to that expectation
You are organized and want your team to deliver timely, high quality software

What you SHOULD KNOW about VaynerMedia
Think “lab” and not “agency”. We get excited about solving business problems, not creating advertising for the sake of making advertising. Our entrepreneurship DNA runs deep. We’re willing to break rules, try new things, and test hypotheses if it means better understanding our craft. It’s fun!
We believe 100% that brands can be built on digital platforms and part of our model is built bottom up, flipping the traditional advertising model and process on its head. We don’t play to agency/industry norms and our culture and energy reflects that.
Our environment (and pace) feels much more like a start-up than most agencies you might be used to. Hopefully that, and the opportunity to collaborate with the talented and enthusiastic crew, work with big brands excites you, as it does us. We can’t wait to meet you.

Soy Víctor, cofundador de Planet 🌍, la única plataforma de automatización y gestión de precios para Shopify en español. Actualmente contamos con más de 500 clientes, con presencia en ¡+65 países diferentes!

Por ello, estamos ampliando nuestro equipo con un programador Front-end para el desarrollo de nuevas funcionalidades para nuestra plataforma. 💻🤙🏻

Qué ofrecemos:
Una oportunidad de escapar de los desarrollos monolíticos. Cada mes lanzamos una funcionalidad nueva, dando pie a progresar con tus conocimientos de desarrollo, y evitar la monotonía de hacer las mismas tareas una y otra vez.
Una organización horizontal donde se tienen en cuenta las diversas opiniones e ideas a la hora de tomar decisiones.
Un entorno de trabajo distendido al máximo. Nos consideramos una familia, y basamos nuestra cultura en la confianza y la cercanía 😊.
El mejor sitio para crecer. Avanzamos rápido, experimentando y aprendiendo juntos.
Horario flexible elegido por la persona. Trabajo por sprints, basado en metodología Scrum.
Salario: 23-27k€ anuales.

Qué puedes esperar de tus primeros meses en Planet:
El primer mes te pondrás a punto para poder desarrollar: aprenderás a usar nuestra plataforma y conocerás sus puntos fuertes y mejorables, prepararás tu entorno de desarrollo y aprenderás a usar las herramientas que tenemos en Front. Podrás ver cómo nos coordinamos e incluso haber colaborado en alguna tarea de desarrollo menor.
En el segundo mes habrás desplegado cambios menores en nuestro sistema de diseño y nuestras extensiones de Shopify con la ayuda de tu mentor.
En el tercer mes te habrás enfrentado a una tarea de desarrollo dentro de nuestra plataforma y para las extensiones de Shopify. Será un mes donde experimentarás a fondo con los stacks de cada entorno.
Al cabo de seis meses esperamos que ya sepas qué se puede y no se puede hacer con la API de Shopify, que participes en el diseño de nuevos addons y que puedas afrontar nuevos desarrollos en la plataforma (siempre con la ayuda de tus compañeros :)).
El objetivo final es que con el tiempo lideres el desarrollos de addons para la sección de automatizaciones, proponiendo soluciones que se adapten a los requisitos y limitaciones de Shopify.

Requisitos técnicos:
Conocimientos demostrables en el desarrollo con Angular o dos años de experiencia laboral en desarrollo web.
El prototipado se desarrolla en Figma y se maqueta en HTML5 y SCSS. Disponemos de una línea de diseño para simplificar este proceso.
Conocimientos básicos de patrones de diseño e interés por desarrollar código que sea fácil de mantener.
La mayor parte de los desarrollos parten de cero, por lo que priman las buenas prácticas. Esto permite ir actualizando las versiones sobre una base sólida y robusta para todo el equipo.
Experiencia con Git.
Conocimientos básicos de MongoDB.
MongoDB es nuestro motor de BBDD principal por lo que cualquier funcionalidad que desarrolles pasará por comunicarte con ella.
Para pruebas, debbuging e incidencias será necesario consultar directamente a la base de datos, por lo que, si tienes experiencia previa te resultará de gran ayuda.
No es necesario conocer todas las tecnologías de nuestro stack, pero sí especial interés por aprender y trabajar con ellas. En el día a día, desarrollarás en Angular@14, pero entrarás en contacto con nuestra infraestructura de AWS, sistema de logs y demás tecnologías.

También, es deseable:
Nos gustan las personas resolutivas, que no tengan miedo a enfrentarse a nuevas situaciones y a trabajar desde la terminal.
El interés por explorar todos los campos y tecnologías es algo esencial; siempre estamos buscando cómo optimizar nuestros procesos, aunque implique integrarnos con otras plataformas o usar otras librerías.
El inglés es algo esencial. Desarrollarás funcionalidad para una plataforma que se usa por todo el mundo; por lo que ayudar en la internacionalización de los textos y tener en cuenta el formateo de números y moneda es parte del día a día."

We believe in Agile principles and values, our teams typically use Kanban and various XP practices, we love DDD and are using an event driven architecture to further decouple our applications and increase resilience.

You will also help your teammates to become more effective and grow their skills.

We do things well, but we’re not complacent. We want to do great work and to be known for it. We are breaking up our applications into microservices that are well tested, independently deployable and highly observable. We are empowering our teams to operate independently and to ship to production as frequently as they see fit. We’re looking for people who can help us to realise this vision and accelerate the journey, who know what great technology looks like and who can mentor our existing team.

We're entrepreneurial and focused: tackling problems head-on without ego.

We highly value each other's time in order to maximize our impact. To achieve this, we do extensive research and write specifications before building, invest in automation, and practice efficient and deliberate communication.

Our headquarter is based in Munich, Germany, but we’re a fully remote company. This is a remote role. While you can live and work wherever you want, at least 6h of your working hours should happen from 9 to 5 in Central European time (UTC+1).
We embrace learning and experimentation. We encourage you to use 10% of your working hours to learn and experiment with new technology, read mind blowing books and blogs or do online courses.
We respect your personal life and provide a family friendly working environment. While we love what we’re doing and are very dedicated to our jobs and the company, we still know what really matters: family and friends. Most of us have kids and share care work equally with our partners, so we know what we’re talking about ;)
20 paid vacation days + public German holidays (to keep organization simple)
32h work week (most of us work on 4 days, some split their off day into two half days, but that’s up to you)

To achieve that we are building a new community around Python opscode for open source applications, running on Kubernetes. We want to move all of Canonical and Ubuntu IS onto this new, open source codebase.

We are confident that we can dramatically improve the experience of running complex business operations - and then we can help our customers embrace those new techniques and products. Traditionally, IS is an inward-facing operation. We would like to transform our IS team into an extension of the product engineering capability at Canonical. Our internal workloads are in many cases the same open source workloads that our customers want to operate. This team will productise those workloads for real-time automated operations on Kubernetes.

This role is ideal for software engineers who enjoy Python, have a passion for distributed systems, and an interest in the entire Linux stack - from kernel to networking to virtualization and containers. It is a role that requires rigour in both code and customer interactions. Our engineers are technically astute open source enthusiasts who are excited about cloud computing and are ready to join a global team charged with delivering world class services to our customers.

Strong Python development skills and familiarity with Kubernetes are key requirements of this role. You'll work closely with other teams in Canonical to ensure your products operate reliably, efficiently and scale to production sized workloads for our customers looking to adopt cutting-edge technology. You will participate and be responsible for ensuring sound software architecture and follow best practices in software quality, testing and documentation.

What you'll do
Work in Python to design and deliver open source software operations code
Work across the entire Linux stack, from kernel, networking, storage, to applications
Learn to think rigorously about application and infrastructure reliability
Shape high quality open source monitoring and alerting infrastructure
Simplify open source operations for our customers and open source community
Demonstrate sound engineering design and testing principles in your code
Follow agile software development practices
Coach and develop your colleagues where you have insights
Grow a healthy, collaborative engineering culture in line with company values
Work from home with global travel once or twice a year for up to 2 weeks for events

Who you are
You love technology and working with brilliant people
You have a Bachelor's or equivalent in Computer Science, STEM or similar degree
You are experienced with Linux systems administration, package management, and operations
You have hands-on experience with at least one public cloud
You are familiar with Docker and Kubernetes
You are an excellent Python programmer and enjoy challenging projects
You understand the importance of reliable software and strive to design and code to that expectation
You are organized and want your team to deliver timely, high quality software

About Canonical

Canonical is a growing international software company that works with the open-source community to deliver Ubuntu, ""the world's best free software platform"". Our mission is to realise the potential of free software in the lives of individuals and organisations.

Samsara (NYSE: IOT) is the pioneer of the Connected Operations Cloud, which helps to digitize the world of physical operations, providing visibility and empowering entire sectors of our economy to become more safe, efficient, and sustainable. Founded in San Francisco in 2015, we now employ more than 2,000 people globally, have 2.3 million IoT devices deployed globally, and collect more than 85 billion minutes of video footage and 4.6 trillion data points annually.

Working at Samsara means you’ll help define the future of physical operations and be on a team that’s shaping an exciting array of product solutions, including video-based safety, vehicle telematics, apps and driver workflows, equipment monitoring, and site visibility.

Our top sales team members seek to learn the ins and outs of the businesses they support in order to make a larger impact.
You build genuine relationships with your customers: The industries we serve have relied on pen-and-paper solutions for years and haven’t been met with the type of technology we offer. Our customers value earned trust and human relationships built over time.
You want to be with the best: Samsara’s high-performance culture means you’ll be surrounded by the best and challenged to go farther than you have before.
You are a team player: At Samsara, sales is a team sport. We help each other out by sharing best practices and focus on winning as a team.

At Matter Labs, we don’t see ourselves as a company, but as a highly aligned global team on a single mission: to accelerate the mass adoption of crypto for personal sovereignty.

Our core technology – zkSync – is a layer 2 rollup that uses advanced cryptography called zero-knowledge proofs to scale Ethereum without compromising on security or decentralization. zkSync is EVM compatible, which means projects on Ethereum and other EVM-based blockchains can easily deploy on zkSync to take advantage of low gas fees and high transaction speeds.

With a total of $458 million in mission-driven funding, zkSync is the first EVM-compatible ZK Rollup to go live on testnet (February 2022) and be deployed on mainnet (October 2022). As we enter the endgame for Ethereum scaling, we are committed to full open source and building in public toward our stated mission [so that even if we fail, the community and the ecosystem will benefit from our contribution].

We are currently live in 5 different countries (UK, Sweden, Netherlands, Italy and Spain), despite only having launched 2 years ago. Here is an example of one of our apps: Pets4Homes.co.uk

Building apps with React, Next.js & React Native
Understanding of GraphQL and its usage in large systems with multiple consumers
Experience with frontend testing tools and testing strategies
Understanding of SEO and other web vital metrics

We expect all candidates to have working proficiency in English.

We are currently expanding our Application Platform team and we are looking for Backend Software Engineer. Is ""security"", ""curiosity"" or ""growth"" your middle name? Then you are a good fit and you can be one of us. You can work remotely or from one of our local offices. The salary starts at €3,000 based on your experience level.

About your role and the team:

The Application Platform team empowers other engineering teams to build their services effectively and with security and compliance built-in by designing, implementing, and maintaining the magic solid foundations and the core frameworks of the Bloomreach Engagement.

Examples of the initiatives driven by this team are:
Integrated zero-trust authentication and authorization management system.
Platform for collecting and processing audit logs in a distributed environment.
Notification center, which allows other teams to communicate information to customers through a single unified channel (upcoming project).

What you might like about this role:
Wide reach - we deal with teams across the company - product, security, architects, engineers, even customers.
Security perspective will be a key element of your day-to-day work
Developing Cloud Native services consumed by customers as well as other engineering teams

What your typical day might look like:

You start your day with a code review of your colleague’s tasks while sipping a cup of fresh-brewed tea or coffee, looking for any signs of problems and possible optimizations. Then you join your teammates on a quick daily standup, where you discuss what you’re currently working on and the plan for the next few days.

After the meeting, you get into “the zone” and spend a few undisturbed hours working on the new authentication framework while making sure it’s safely covered by a suite of unit tests. With a few clicks you quickly spin up a brand new instance of the system in the development cluster, deploy your change and notify the frontend engineer that it’s ready.

You grab a snack and take a little break from coding. Instead, you help a fellow backend engineer from another team figure out the best way to integrate their new service with the audit logging platform. In the meantime the frontend engineer gets back to you and confirms that all the new endpoints work as expected, so you create a merge request and ask your teammates for a code review. It’s a complex piece of code, so you go through it together.

After your code is approved, you merge it, automatically deploying it to the staging environment where it receives further testing by the QA team and automated integration tests before being released to production.

You end your day in a short meeting with a product manager and the director of engineering, where you flesh out the idea you had over lunch yesterday for a new approach to release management that would make the whole process even faster.

Our tech stack:
Python & Go
MongoDB, Redis, Apache Kafka
Kubernetes (GKE)
Various Google Cloud Platform services (Pub/Sub, BigTable, DataFlow, ...)
Gitlab CI/CD, Prometheus and Grafana

What we expect of the candidate:

The ideal candidate has:
At least 3 year experience developing in Python or Golang
Designing and implementing production-grade REST APIs
Having experience with operating services in production is beneficial
A working understanding of fundamental web security principles (OWASP), Authentication and Authorization practices
Experience with database systems of different kinds (MongoDB, Redis, Apache Kafka)

Regional benefits:
Monthly lunch entitlement by up to 110€ per month
Pension scheme or Health insurance depending on region

I’m excited to open this position because it has many responsibilities I want as an engineer. As a product engineer, you’ll take ownership over a large portion of one of our products and own projects end-to-end (wearing hats traditionally worn by product and design). You’ll, for example, research competitors, write product specs, and implement features from frontend to backend. To ground it with examples, product engineers at Ashby have:
Designed and built automated candidate scheduling. This feature automates scheduling by calculating possible times from a pool of interviewers and presenting these times to the candidate for selection via our responsive web app.
Built a generalized filter architecture that allows users to create complex filters for any record with a consistent UI and compile it to SQL in our backend. Many user-facing features use it.
Spec-ed, designed, and implemented a feature that allows users to complete the process of signing offers entirely within Ashby. This project involved talking to customers to understand their requirements, deciding what technologies to use, building a prototype, and working with other team members to integrate the final implementation into additional features.

These projects reflect what we’re accomplishing at Ashby: improving the productivity of working professionals (starting with talent teams) with intelligent and powerful software. We put a lot of effort into designing products that are approachable to beginners but mastered & extended by power users. In many ways, spreadsheets set the bar here.

We have many customers, great revenue growth, years of runway, and amazing investors like YCombinator, Elad Gil, and Lachy Groom. I’ll share more once we meet.

One formality, we do require at least 8 years of experience as a full-time software engineer for this role.

Engineering Culture

Our engineering culture is motivated by Benji’s (my co-founder and CEO) and my belief that a small talented team, given the right environment, can build high-quality software fast (and work regular hours!).

Collaboration is Natural & Communication is Deliberate

Our engineering team (and the team at large) consists of lifelong learners who are humble and kind (meet them here!). These attributes create an environment where collaboration happens naturally (we filter for it in interviews). We combine this with research, prototyping, and written proposals to see around corners and get feedback from the team across time zones. Focus time is something that we hold sacred, and, with thoughtful and deliberate communication, engineers can focus 36h out of a 40h work week (I wrote about it here).

Increase Leverage, not Team Size

We built Ashby with the quality, breadth, and depth that many customers would expect from much larger teams over larger time scales. We’ve done this through investment in:
Great developer tooling. Our CI/CD takes ~10m, and we deploy at least 10x a day. Everyone on the team has contributed to developer experience 💪🏾
Building blocks to create powerful and customizable products fast. At the core of Ashby is a set of common components (analytics modeling and query language, policy engine, workflow engine, design system) which we are constantly improving. Each improvement to a common component cascades throughout our app (short video below).

Here’s an impromptu quote from Arjun in our company Slack of what it’s like to build a feature at Ashby:

And a demo of one of these building blocks:

Give Engineers Ownership & Autonomy

We, as engineers, find clever ways to solve problems, which amplifies when we deeply understand the problem. Benji and I did our best work as engineers when we had a deep understanding of the end-user and the business and ownership over the solution. Our engineering culture reflects this experience: engineers own projects end-to-end, from speaking with users to writing product specs to UX design. These are skills that we often don’t get to practice as engineers, and, at Ashby, we provide mentorship to grow them and help from the team where you want it.

Put Effort into Diversity

Diverse teams drive innovation and better outcomes. Having seen my mother and partner build their careers as minority women in non-diverse fields, I want to make sure Ashby creates opportunities for the next generation of engineers from underrepresented groups.

Today, 26% of engineers at Ashby are from underrepresented groups. It’s not great, and we are taking conscious steps to improve, like sourcing diverse candidates, providing generous paid family leave, no leetcode interviews, and more.

Interview Process

At Ashby, our team and interview process want to help you show your best self. We’ll dive into past projects and simulate working together via pair programming, writing tech specs collaboratively, and talking through decisions (no leetcode or whiteboard exercises). Our interview process is three rounds:
30-minute introduction call (we demo Ashby!)
A technical screen (take home or 75-minute in-person)
A virtual on-site of 3 hours and 30 minutes (can be split across two days)

Your hiring manager will be your main point of contact and prep you for interviews. You’ll meet my co-founder and CEO plus 4 to 6 people in engineering (with 15 minutes in each interview to ask them questions). If we don’t give an offer, we’ll provide feedback!

Your First Two Months at Ashby

We want an exceptional onboarding experience for every new hire. At Ashby, your dev environment sets up with a single script, you push your first change on day one, and we spend the rest of the time building your confidence in our codebase and practices culminating in the delivery of a prominent, impactful feature. We’ll pair you with a peer who’ll guide you through your first tasks and be someone you rely on, from answering questions to pair programming.

Technology Stack

I’m sharing our tech stack with the caveat that we don’t require previous experience in it (but a love of typed languages is helpful 😀): TypeScript (frontend & backend), Node.js, React, Apollo GraphQL, Postgres, Redis.

Benefits
Competitive salary and equity.
10-year exercise window for stock options. You shouldn’t feel pressure to purchase stock options if you leave Ashby —do it when you feel financially comfortable.
Unlimited PTO with four weeks recommended per year. Expect “Vacation?” in our one-on-one agenda until you start taking it 😅.
Twelve weeks of fully paid family leave in the US. We plan to expand this to employees in other countries as situations arise.
Generous equipment, software, and office furniture budget. Get what you need to be happy and productive!
$100/month education budget with more expensive items (like conferences) covered with manager approval.
If you’re in the US, top-notch health insurance for you and your dependents with all premiums covered by us.

Ashby’s success hinges on hiring great people and creating an environment where we can be happy, feel challenged, and do our best work. We’re being deliberate about building that environment from the ground up. I hope that excites you enough to apply.

Ashby provides equal employment opportunities (EEO) to all employees and applicants for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, genetics, sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression. We are committed to a diverse and inclusive workforce and welcome people from all backgrounds, experiences, perspectives, and abilities.

Docker, Kubernetes and other cloud-native technologies have made us better than ever at operating our systems in production, but the day-to-day development experience has been left lagging behind.

Developers spend less time in flow, and more time waiting for builds, debugging scripts, or otherwise fighting their tools. We're here to fix that.

Our platform—which includes our open source core product—allows developer to work on distributed systems in remote, production-like dev environments while enjoying the same fast and frictionless feedback loops we've come to expect when developing a single service locally.

It's a platform that democratizes the kind of advanced developer tooling that only the largest software companies have the resources to build and maintain.

We're still a small team and you'd be joining as an individual contributor at a time where you can have a huge impact on our product and our culture. If you've ever thought to yourself that something's not right with our modern development workflows, now's your chance to help fix it!

What you'll do

As a Community Engineer, you'll empower Garden's community champions, steer the direction of our OSS product by bridging feedback to our engineering teams, and speak directly with Garden's users in service of making Garden the best user experience it can be.

More specifically you'll:
Create demo projects, tutorials, and various other creative content to ease adoption of Garden for DevOps Engineers, SREs, and developers.
Think big and create your own community initiatives to drive adoption and activate our community.
Speak directly to our engineering teams with feedback from the community, write GitHub issues, and facilitate community contributions to Garden OSS.

Who you are
You're passionate about developer productivity and removing obstacles to a smooth, easy developer experience.
You love technical writing and love helping people to understand complex technical topics in an accessible way.
Connecting with community whether on the stage or informally has been an important part of your career or you think it could be, given the opportunity.

Here's your chance to bring your passion to Garden's community and customers with examples and technical content that accelerate their delivery pipelines.

Qualifications
You have 2+ years of Kubernetes experience.
You have excellent interpersonal and written communication skills.
You're passionate about open source products and communities.
Experience writing code (in particular in Node.js/Typescript) is a big plus but not a requirement.
You're happy to work with a team that is still figuring a lot of things out, and values trust, openness, and collaboration while doing so.

We explicitly encourage applications from groups that are underrepresented in tech. We celebrate and encourage diversity of race, religion, color, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, age and thought. Diversity is easier said than done but it's one of our founding principles to provide a diverse and inclusive environment.

Working at Garden
A culture fostering individuals and teams to do their best work in a friendly, positive, diverse and inclusive environment.
A policy of no meetings Tuesday through Thursday. We respect your right to Deep Work.
Competitive compensation
You can work fully remote or join us at our HQ in vibrant Berlin, Germany (see Remote's Country Explorer for a list of all countries we support)
Wellness stipend and membership in Berlin
Your own work computer of your choice with OS of your choice (macOS, Linux, or Windows)
2000 euro yearly professional development stipend

Our Process

We're a small team that tries to keep things simple and lean—and that applies to our interview process as well.

The first step is an intro call with our Director of People. The goal is to give both parties a chance to get to know each other, ask questions and discuss the culture at Garden, as well as to talk about salary and availability. The next step is an Interview with someone from our Community Engineering team and CTO. The goal is to give both parties a chance to get to know one another and to discuss the role.

After that you'll have a 60-minute technical interview with our engineers. We have a real conversation about things you've actually done in the past and dig deep into those.

The final step is a 60-minute demo + Q&A. In the demo you present work you've done in the past to people from our engineering teams. We want everyone involved in the process, so this is also a chance for you to meet the rest of the team and vice versa."

En lijkt consultancy jou wel wat? Maar wil je niet ergens eenzaam op de 10e verdieping eindigen? Dan is werken als Java Developer bij Acorel misschien wel wat voor jou!

Veel afwisseling en boeiende projecten

Acorel is een midden klein bedrijf met ongeveer 80 medewerkers. Dat betekent dat we groot genoeg zijn om jou interessante projecten en rollen aan te bieden, maar ook klein genoeg om te kijken naar welke projecten en rollen daadwerkelijk passen bij jouw talenten.

We werken voor uiteenlopende klanten en onderscheiden ons met onze focus op Customer Experience. Meestal komen we binnen bij grote bedrijven die hun eerste stap in hun digitale transformatie moeten maken. Wij helpen ze bij het ontwikkelen IT-oplossingen die hun helpen om hun klantbeleving te verbeteren. Je kunt bijvoorbeeld denken aan het maken van de webshop van Canon of zorgen dat elektrische auto’s kunnen laden bij de laadpalen van Alliander.

Als je een collega zou vragen wat ze leuk vinden aan het consultancy werk bij Acorel is het de afwisseling en de doorgroeimogelijkheden. Het is veel puzzelen. Je bent namelijk met veel verschillende technieken bezig, waardoor je binnen een korte tijd je skillset enorm kan uitbreiden, maar er ook tegen moet kunnen om veel op te moeten zoeken. Hetgeen wat collega’s het minst leuk vinden aan het werk is aan niet technische mensen iets technisch uitleggen. Dit kan soms ingewikkeld en frustrerend zijn, maar is wel belangrijk in het werk als Development Consultant.

Vanuit Acorel word je gefaciliteerd en gestimuleerd

Het werken voor een midden klein bedrijf heeft ook nog andere voordelen. We zijn geen chaotische startup, maar hebben onze zaken goed op orde. We geven je duidelijkheid over arbeidsvoorwaarden, processen en rollen/verwachtingen. Alles staat transparant beschreven op ons personeelsdomein.

Op dit personeelsdomein kun je ook alle activiteiten en trainingen vinden. Jaarlijks wordt er namelijk behoorlijk wat georganiseerd, zoals bijvoorbeeld een NLP-cursus en geluksworkshop tot padel en bierproeverij. Dit gaat op vrijwillige basis en in kleinere groepjes voor meer interactie en verbinding met collega’s.

Je wordt ingedeeld in een grotere groep met ‘likeminded people’, mensen waar jij direct iets van kan leren en waar kennisdeling centraal staat. Elke groep heeft een groepsmanager die verantwoordelijk is voor jouw ontwikkeling. Hij of zij stimuleert jou om jezelf te blijven ontwikkelen en zorgt ervoor dat je op het juiste project zit dat aansluit bij jouw individuele leerbehoefte. Je kunt ook wisselen van groep als je interesses wisselen. We hebben namelijk 2 verschillende expertises binnen de development teams:

e-Commerce
Integration

Het leukste aan het werken bij Acorel: de collega’s

Het fijnste bij Acorel is dat je bij ons geen nummertje bent en dat je al vanaf dag één meedraait als volwaardig teamlid. We stellen graag vragen, luisteren en onderzoeken. De collega’s hier hebben een échte interesse in de mens.

Het leuke is dat de ondernemers ook nog aan het roer staan en dat merk je. Ze zijn een drijvende kracht in het stimuleren van persoonlijk ondernemerschap met elk hun eigen stijl.

De collega’s zijn daarnaast vriendelijk en staan altijd klaar om je verder te helpen wanneer je vastzit. De cultuur wordt door de collega’s beschreven als ‘open’ en ‘informeel’. Een gezonde werk-privé balans vinden wij belangrijk. De groepsmanager houden een oogje in het zeil of het werk niet te veel of uitdagend genoeg is. Je bepaalt zelf of het effectiever is om thuis te werken of je gezicht te laten zien bij de klant of op kantoor. Geen individualistische consultancy cultuur, maar samen problemen oplossen en het elke keer een beetje beter doen.

Hopelijk geeft dit jou een beter beeld, maar mocht je meer vragen hebben of vrijblijvend willen kennismaken, kun je natuurlijk ook met ons contact opnemen. En als je meteen enthousiast bent, kun je natuurlijk ook direct solliciteren door op de solliciteer button te klikken!
Desired Skills and Experience
Wat zoeken wij?

Je hebt een afgeronde relevante HBO of WO opleiding (zoals ICT, Business & IT, Bedrijfskundige Informatica, Software Engineering of dergelijke);
Je hebt 0-3 jaar werkervaring als developer of software engineer met Java;
Je bent oplossingsgericht en nieuwsgierig;
Jij bent een teamspeler en pakt je verantwoordelijkheid.
Uitstekende beheersing van de Nederlandse én Engelse taal in woord en geschrift.

Wat bieden wij jou?

Salaris tussen €2.500,- en €3.500,- bruto per maand (afhankelijk van kennis & ervaring);
Hybride werken en flexibele arbeidstijden;
Leaseauto, telefoon & laptop van de zaak;
Ruimte voor ontwikkeling en eigen ondernemerschap.
Enthousiaste en gedreven collega’s, een transparante en prettige werksfeer en een flexibele, groeiende organisatie.

The Wikimedia Foundation is looking for a Site Reliability Engineer (Database) to join our SRE team to build, optimize and support the platform serving the world's favorite encyclopædia to millions of people around the globe. Wikipedia and its sister projects are a globally distributed architecture powered strictly by Free and Open Source software. The stack has MediaWiki at its core and MariaDB as its data store, surrounded by an ecosystem of microservices in PHP, NodeJS, Python, Go and Java.

The Wikimedia community continuously generates text content in the form of new articles, revisions and discussions. As part of our team you would have the opportunity to solve the storage, scaling, access and backup challenges that Wikipedias' scale provides.

Our goal is configuring and managing the database infrastructure in a way that maximizes the service uptime for Wikimedia projects' users while at the same time simplifying the operational processes, automating repeatable tasks and applying industry best practices.

We are a globally distributed and diverse team of engineers with a drive to explore, experiment and embrace new technologies.

Perform day-to-day operational/DevOps tasks on Wikimedia's public facing infrastructure (deployment, maintenance, configuration, troubleshooting)
Implement and utilize configuration management and deployment tools
Monitor systems, services and service clusters, optimize performance and resource utilization
Participate in incident response, diagnosis and follow-up on system outages or alerts across Wikimedia's production infrastructure
Share our values and work in accordance with them

Skills and Experience:
2+ years experience in a DBA role as part of a team
3+ years experience with Linux in a production environment
Knowledge and experience of (Free and Open Source) RDBMS (preferably MariaDB or MySQL) administration (understanding of and experience with replication is essential) and support, debugging query performance and schema design
Comfortable with shell and at least one of the scripting languages used in an SRE/Operations engineering context (Python, Go, Bash, Ruby, etc.)
Passion for automating tasks and processes
Strong English language skills and ability to work independently, as an effective part of a globally distributed team
B.S. or M.S. in Computer Science or equivalent work experience

Additionally, we'd love it if you have:
Experience working with or as a part of SRE/Operations/DevOps teams
Experience with NoSQL products (Cassandra, Redis, Elasticsearch, etc.)
Experience with LAMP stack technologies (PHP/HHVM, memcached/redis, MySQL) - MediaWiki familiarity would be great!

Work closely with engineering teams, product owners, and other stakeholders to define service operations, identify operational issues early and prevent them
Help define Service Level Objectives to assess release readiness of all services
Develop software, tooling, and processes to automate our operations
Measure and optimize system performance

At Open Systems SREs are driven by improving the operations of our services, measured by the level of service that we provide to our customers, the resources that we need to operate our services, and the interest of our operational work in our Mission Control NOC. SREs work in partnership with platform and service engineering teams in different capacity—from consulting to joint engineering projects—to drive the operational improvements across the entire lifecycle of our services.

As part of your SRE responsibilities, and through the Open Systems training and courses, you will become certified as a Mission Control Engineer, providing you with knowledge in a wide area covering networking and security topics. This will give you the opportunity to visit our Mission Control NOC in Honolulu for deployments of 2 to 3 months, where travel and accommodation is also afforded to your partner and children.

You may already have experience with the whole breadth of the SRE role already, but do not let it stop you if you do not. We also support you making a transition to SRE from a strong skillset in software engineering, DevOps, or platform engineering. In that case you should be able to explain why would want to make this transition.

You will have the option to work full-time or part-time 80%.

Open Systems will offer you interesting challenges in the dynamic and global environment of SD-WAN and cybersecurity. You will be in a work environment in which innovative solutions, rapid development times, creativity, and open communication are practiced and continuously fostered. The pursuit of technical advancement is at the center of our attention. Our employees are known as enthusiastic, humorous, and passionate individuals.

You are experienced with Linux systems administration, package management, and operations
You have hands-on experience with at least one public cloud
You are familiar with Docker and Kubernetes

Soy Víctor, cofundador de Planet 🌍, la única plataforma de automatización y gestión de precios para Shopify en español. Actualmente contamos con más de 500 clientes, con presencia en ¡+65 países diferentes!

Por ello, estamos ampliando nuestro equipo con un programador Front-end para el desarrollo de nuevas funcionalidades para nuestra plataforma. 💻🤙🏻

Qué ofrecemos:
Una oportunidad de escapar de los desarrollos monolíticos. Cada mes lanzamos una funcionalidad nueva, dando pie a progresar con tus conocimientos de desarrollo, y evitar la monotonía de hacer las mismas tareas una y otra vez.
Una organización horizontal donde se tienen en cuenta las diversas opiniones e ideas a la hora de tomar decisiones.
Un entorno de trabajo distendido al máximo. Nos consideramos una familia, y basamos nuestra cultura en la confianza y la cercanía 😊.
El mejor sitio para crecer. Avanzamos rápido, experimentando y aprendiendo juntos.
Horario flexible elegido por la persona. Trabajo por sprints, basado en metodología Scrum.
Salario: 23-27k€ anuales.

Qué puedes esperar de tus primeros meses en Planet:
El primer mes te pondrás a punto para poder desarrollar: aprenderás a usar nuestra plataforma y conocerás sus puntos fuertes y mejorables, prepararás tu entorno de desarrollo y aprenderás a usar las herramientas que tenemos en Front. Podrás ver cómo nos coordinamos e incluso haber colaborado en alguna tarea de desarrollo menor.
En el segundo mes habrás desplegado cambios menores en nuestro sistema de diseño y nuestras extensiones de Shopify con la ayuda de tu mentor.
En el tercer mes te habrás enfrentado a una tarea de desarrollo dentro de nuestra plataforma y para las extensiones de Shopify. Será un mes donde experimentarás a fondo con los stacks de cada entorno.
Al cabo de seis meses esperamos que ya sepas qué se puede y no se puede hacer con la API de Shopify, que participes en el diseño de nuevos addons y que puedas afrontar nuevos desarrollos en la plataforma (siempre con la ayuda de tus compañeros :)).
El objetivo final es que con el tiempo lideres el desarrollos de addons para la sección de automatizaciones, proponiendo soluciones que se adapten a los requisitos y limitaciones de Shopify.

Requisitos técnicos:
Conocimientos demostrables en el desarrollo con Angular o dos años de experiencia laboral en desarrollo web.
El prototipado se desarrolla en Figma y se maqueta en HTML5 y SCSS. Disponemos de una línea de diseño para simplificar este proceso.
Conocimientos básicos de patrones de diseño e interés por desarrollar código que sea fácil de mantener.
La mayor parte de los desarrollos parten de cero, por lo que priman las buenas prácticas. Esto permite ir actualizando las versiones sobre una base sólida y robusta para todo el equipo.
Experiencia con Git.
Conocimientos básicos de MongoDB.
MongoDB es nuestro motor de BBDD principal por lo que cualquier funcionalidad que desarrolles pasará por comunicarte con ella.
Para pruebas, debbuging e incidencias será necesario consultar directamente a la base de datos, por lo que, si tienes experiencia previa te resultará de gran ayuda.
No es necesario conocer todas las tecnologías de nuestro stack, pero sí especial interés por aprender y trabajar con ellas. En el día a día, desarrollarás en Angular@14, pero entrarás en contacto con nuestra infraestructura de AWS, sistema de logs y demás tecnologías.

También, es deseable:
Nos gustan las personas resolutivas, que no tengan miedo a enfrentarse a nuevas situaciones y a trabajar desde la terminal.
El interés por explorar todos los campos y tecnologías es algo esencial; siempre estamos buscando cómo optimizar nuestros procesos, aunque implique integrarnos con otras plataformas o usar otras librerías.
El inglés es algo esencial. Desarrollarás funcionalidad para una plataforma que se usa por todo el mundo; por lo que ayudar en la internacionalización de los textos y tener en cuenta el formateo de números y moneda es parte del día a día."

Soy Víctor, cofundador de Planet 🌍, la única plataforma de automatización y gestión de precios para Shopify en español. Actualmente contamos con más de 500 clientes, con presencia en ¡+65 países diferentes!

Por ello, estamos ampliando nuestro equipo con un programador Front-end para el desarrollo de nuevas funcionalidades para nuestra plataforma. 💻🤙🏻

Qué ofrecemos:
Una oportunidad de escapar de los desarrollos monolíticos. Cada mes lanzamos una funcionalidad nueva, dando pie a progresar con tus conocimientos de desarrollo, y evitar la monotonía de hacer las mismas tareas una y otra vez.
Una organización horizontal donde se tienen en cuenta las diversas opiniones e ideas a la hora de tomar decisiones.
Un entorno de trabajo distendido al máximo. Nos consideramos una familia, y basamos nuestra cultura en la confianza y la cercanía 😊.
El mejor sitio para crecer. Avanzamos rápido, experimentando y aprendiendo juntos.
Horario flexible elegido por la persona. Trabajo por sprints, basado en metodología Scrum.
Salario: 23-27k€ anuales.

Qué puedes esperar de tus primeros meses en Planet:
El primer mes te pondrás a punto para poder desarrollar: aprenderás a usar nuestra plataforma y conocerás sus puntos fuertes y mejorables, prepararás tu entorno de desarrollo y aprenderás a usar las herramientas que tenemos en Front. Podrás ver cómo nos coordinamos e incluso haber colaborado en alguna tarea de desarrollo menor.
En el segundo mes habrás desplegado cambios menores en nuestro sistema de diseño y nuestras extensiones de Shopify con la ayuda de tu mentor.
En el tercer mes te habrás enfrentado a una tarea de desarrollo dentro de nuestra plataforma y para las extensiones de Shopify. Será un mes donde experimentarás a fondo con los stacks de cada entorno.
Al cabo de seis meses esperamos que ya sepas qué se puede y no se puede hacer con la API de Shopify, que participes en el diseño de nuevos addons y que puedas afrontar nuevos desarrollos en la plataforma (siempre con la ayuda de tus compañeros :)).
El objetivo final es que con el tiempo lideres el desarrollos de addons para la sección de automatizaciones, proponiendo soluciones que se adapten a los requisitos y limitaciones de Shopify.

Requisitos técnicos:
Conocimientos demostrables en el desarrollo con Angular o dos años de experiencia laboral en desarrollo web.
El prototipado se desarrolla en Figma y se maqueta en HTML5 y SCSS. Disponemos de una línea de diseño para simplificar este proceso.
Conocimientos básicos de patrones de diseño e interés por desarrollar código que sea fácil de mantener.
La mayor parte de los desarrollos parten de cero, por lo que priman las buenas prácticas. Esto permite ir actualizando las versiones sobre una base sólida y robusta para todo el equipo.
Experiencia con Git.
Conocimientos básicos de MongoDB.
MongoDB es nuestro motor de BBDD principal por lo que cualquier funcionalidad que desarrolles pasará por comunicarte con ella.
Para pruebas, debbuging e incidencias será necesario consultar directamente a la base de datos, por lo que, si tienes experiencia previa te resultará de gran ayuda.
No es necesario conocer todas las tecnologías de nuestro stack, pero sí especial interés por aprender y trabajar con ellas. En el día a día, desarrollarás en Angular@14, pero entrarás en contacto con nuestra infraestructura de AWS, sistema de logs y demás tecnologías.

También, es deseable:
Nos gustan las personas resolutivas, que no tengan miedo a enfrentarse a nuevas situaciones y a trabajar desde la terminal.
El interés por explorar todos los campos y tecnologías es algo esencial; siempre estamos buscando cómo optimizar nuestros procesos, aunque implique integrarnos con otras plataformas o usar otras librerías.
El inglés es algo esencial. Desarrollarás funcionalidad para una plataforma que se usa por todo el mundo; por lo que ayudar en la internacionalización de los textos y tener en cuenta el formateo de números y moneda es parte del día a día."

This role is remote in Poland. We are only able to accept applications for those based in Poland or have sponsorship to live and work in Poland.

What you'll do at Jamf:

At Jamf, we empower people to be their best selves and do their best work. You will join a unit of Cloud Engineers that contribute to Jamf Security portfolio.

If Data is the new gold and you are the King of Data… what does that make you? Not sure, but you are certainly a DBA! And if you are the type of DBA that is not married to a particular technology, likes to get his hands dirty and is interested in everything related to databases then you might be what we are looking for to scale our DBA team.

What we need from you:

The DBA Team owns many core database clusters in Production as well several other instances on a wide range of technologies. You will work alongside the rest of our DBAs in a small and agile team that owns their direction of travel.

Your primary focus will be scalability, integrity, performance, availability, security, monitoring and troubleshooting of our core DB clusters, exploring new ways of consolidating data sources and making more data available to more people at Jamf and last but not least supporting our Dev Teams as they build the new features that will shape the future of Jamf.

And if you are not scared of doing some coding, you can get involved in how we build and monitor our DBs, using technologies like Terraform and Prometheus.

Some of the traits we expect from you:
No challenge is too big or too small for you. You get excited at the prospect of a complex project and at the same time you understand that small improvements can sometimes make a massive difference.
You hold yourself and your team to a high standard when working in production.
You have some cloud experience, ideally with AWS.
You have experience with at least 2 different DB technologies as well as awesome SQL skills and ideally NoSQL as well. We use Dremio, Vertica, Mongo as well as other technologies. But we won’t frown upon you if Oracle is your cup of tea.

Hi, want to build out the future of content automation with us?

Storyteq is a Creative Marketing Operations Platform that empowers digital creative leads and marketing leaders, in top global brands and agencies to optimise and scale the way they create and manage digital creative assets. We believe creativity takes time, but creative production shouldn't.

Our endless curiosity and relentless commitment to our customers lies at the heart of our approach to solving problems. This common mission is weaved into our values: we take risks (be bold), thrive on change (move fast), and lead with trust (stay familiar).

These geniuses have created our chatbot – the lovely Rita – and they didn’t stop there 🤯

They’ve also created automated FinCrime quality controls in a few weeks. Yes, they’re just that good!

You’ll never work alone, either. As a Python Engineer, you’ll sit within a Product Team – simultaneously working with Data Scientists, Analysts, Engineers, Product Owners and Operations Managers to solve problems and make our rocket ship fly even higher 🚀

What You’ll Be Doing
Building APIs making sure they are properly designed and scale according to the business needs

An academic background in a STEM subject

Building a global financial super app isn’t enough. Our Revoluters are a priority, and that’s why in 2021 we launched our inaugural D&I Framework, designed to help us thrive and grow everyday. We're not just doing this because it's the right thing to do. We’re doing it because we know that seeking out diverse talent and creating an inclusive workplace is the way to create exceptional, innovative products and services for our customers.

Garden's mission is to keep developers productive and happy in the cloud-native era.

Docker, Kubernetes and other cloud-native technologies have made us better than ever at operating our systems in production, but the day-to-day development experience has been left lagging behind.

Developers spend less time in flow, and more time waiting for builds, debugging scripts, or otherwise fighting their tools. We're here to fix that.

Our platform—which includes our open source core product—allows developer to work on distributed systems in remote, production-like dev environments while enjoying the same fast and frictionless feedback loops we've come to expect when developing a single service locally.

It's a platform that democratizes the kind of advanced developer tooling that only the largest software companies have the resources to build and maintain.

We're still a small team and you'd be joining as an individual contributor at a time where you can have a huge impact on our product and our culture. If you've ever thought to yourself that something's not right with our modern development workflows, now's your chance to help fix it!

What you'll do

As a Community Engineer, you'll empower Garden's community champions, steer the direction of our OSS product by bridging feedback to our engineering teams, and speak directly with Garden's users in service of making Garden the best user experience it can be.

More specifically you'll:
Create demo projects, tutorials, and various other creative content to ease adoption of Garden for DevOps Engineers, SREs, and developers.
Think big and create your own community initiatives to drive adoption and activate our community.
Speak directly to our engineering teams with feedback from the community, write GitHub issues, and facilitate community contributions to Garden OSS.

Who you are
You're passionate about developer productivity and removing obstacles to a smooth, easy developer experience.
You love technical writing and love helping people to understand complex technical topics in an accessible way.
Connecting with community whether on the stage or informally has been an important part of your career or you think it could be, given the opportunity.

Here's your chance to bring your passion to Garden's community and customers with examples and technical content that accelerate their delivery pipelines.

Qualifications
You have 2+ years of Kubernetes experience.
You have excellent interpersonal and written communication skills.
You're passionate about open source products and communities.
Experience writing code (in particular in Node.js/Typescript) is a big plus but not a requirement.
You're happy to work with a team that is still figuring a lot of things out, and values trust, openness, and collaboration while doing so.

We explicitly encourage applications from groups that are underrepresented in tech. We celebrate and encourage diversity of race, religion, color, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, age and thought. Diversity is easier said than done but it's one of our founding principles to provide a diverse and inclusive environment.

Working at Garden
A culture fostering individuals and teams to do their best work in a friendly, positive, diverse and inclusive environment.
A policy of no meetings Tuesday through Thursday. We respect your right to Deep Work.
Competitive compensation
You can work fully remote or join us at our HQ in vibrant Berlin, Germany (see Remote's Country Explorer for a list of all countries we support)
Wellness stipend and membership in Berlin
Your own work computer of your choice with OS of your choice (macOS, Linux, or Windows)
2000 euro yearly professional development stipend

Our Process

We're a small team that tries to keep things simple and lean—and that applies to our interview process as well.

The first step is an intro call with our Director of People. The goal is to give both parties a chance to get to know each other, ask questions and discuss the culture at Garden, as well as to talk about salary and availability. The next step is an Interview with someone from our Community Engineering team and CTO. The goal is to give both parties a chance to get to know one another and to discuss the role.

After that you'll have a 60-minute technical interview with our engineers. We have a real conversation about things you've actually done in the past and dig deep into those.

The final step is a 60-minute demo + Q&A. In the demo you present work you've done in the past to people from our engineering teams. We want everyone involved in the process, so this is also a chance for you to meet the rest of the team and vice versa."

You are experienced with Linux systems administration, package management, and operations
You have hands-on experience with at least one public cloud
You are familiar with Docker and Kubernetes
You are an excellent Python programmer and enjoy challenging projects
You understand the importance of reliable software and strive to design and code to that expectation
You are organized and want your team to deliver timely, high quality software

The role will require you to utilise your knowledge of best practise development principles where you can design, develop and implement new features for our SaaS platform, whilst making our product even more scalable and awesome.

Your main responsibilities:

Building new platform features in our Vue.js front-end and Node.js back-end
Building new features for our state-of-the-art Vue.js.-based Template Builder
Working on our After Effects extension and rendering pipeline
Taking our testing workflows to the next level
Scaling up our code architecture and infrastructure

Besides fun to work with, you...

Have proven software engineering experience gained in a Product / SaaS based environment
Are a master of the JavaScript ecosystem
Have experience with Vue.js
Have experience with Node.js
Are familiar with testing and rely on it on a daily basis
Have affinity with rendering technologies (like ffmpeg)

Overstory's mission is to help solve our climate crisis by providing real-time intelligence about the planet's vegetation. In our first step toward this mission, we are applying machine learning to satellite imagery to track forests and vegetation, helping to reduce the risk of wildfires and power outages.

We have already proven our business model and we're all united behind our ambitious vision to scale up this model to help humanity and the planet. We recently raised a round of funding, led by Convective Capital. Other investors include: B Capital Group, Moxxie Ventures, Capital T, Pale Blue Dot and many other climate-focussed investors.

If you want to have a real impact and solve some of the world's most complex challenges with advanced technology, come work with our talented and passionate team. Overstory is based in Amsterdam but we are a remote-first company, with people living all over the U.S. and Europe.

About The Role

We are looking for a Principal Data Scientist who is a creative, but pragmatic, problem-solver. Reporting into VP Engineering you will be the most senior Data Scientist on the team. You'll spend most of your time working autonomously or within a small team, building, improving, and running our models. You will work closely with the CTO setting, planning, and executing the long-term vision for our ML platform.

This is a hands-on role that will involve exploring satellite imagery sets and other geographical datasets; using machine learning to analyze the images; and working with the teams to deliver the results to our customers. We have models and pipelines at various stages of maturity and we would expect you to use and apply the results of the stable ones and help us improve and validate the ones still in early development. You will work with the team to implement new ML techniques, models, and algorithms that bring step changes to our analyses.

Big part of the role is using the outputs of our analyses to solve customer needs. You will work closely with our Customer Success team to understand the customers' problems and then work with other Data Scientists and the rest of the tech team to come up with solutions to those problems. You will help us adapt our models to different customer needs, but also environmental and vegetative factors.

On a typical day you could be: running inference on satellite imagery, checking the quality of the output, tweaking the input parameters, and retraining the model with new labels; writing Python code to process and analyze GIS data; researching and incorporating new datasets into your project and sharing findings with the team; reading about the latest Deep Learning techniques and applying them to our datasets.

You will have responsibility for your own projects, and we'll expect you to take initiative to help us improve overall. Whether the work is about forest damage detection, tree species identification or biodiversity monitoring, you are up for the challenge!

About You
You are creative and curious.
You are pragmatic, you know when a simple solution is sufficient or when new model development is required.
You are a strong communicator, able to express your ideas succinctly. You make complex ideas accessible to others.
You have an eye for quality, your work is thorough, and you pay attention to both the small details and the larger picture.
Teamwork is at your core, and you like to help others grow and succeed.

Requirements
You have at least 8 years of commercial experience as a Data Scientist or Machine Learning Engineer.
You have spent at least 3 years working in a startup environment (preferably early stage).
You have advanced Python experience (including PyTorch and/or Tensorflow).
Experience working with GIS systems and processing GIS data.
Experience processing satellite data and/or imagery.

What You Get
To be part of truly mission-driven work that reduces wildfires, protects earth's natural resources and helps solve our climate crisis.
Flexible working environment with a lot of autonomy. We build our work days around our lives, not the other way around.
Other benefits like a remote working budget, an educational budget and time to develop new skills.
To be surrounded by an excellent, vibrant, smart team who have each other's back and believe in a culture of openness, tolerance and respect.
Equity and a competitive salary.

About Our Team

We are a group of 33 people from all over the world. Eleven nationalities are represented in our team. We work remotely from seven different countries and occasionally (optionally!) meet up for in-person collaboration.

Diversity & Inclusion

We place enormous value on diversity and inclusion with regards to gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation, religion, age, education, disability, disciplines and skillsets. We believe that the best ideas emerge when people with different perspectives and approaches work together on a problem.

We're always looking to diversify our team further, but we're proud of the fact that four out of the eight people on our leadership team are female or non-white males, 40% of the overall team identifies as female and 25% of the team are people of color.

Pet Media Group (PMG) is a Stockholm-based startup that acquires, launches and develops market-leading pet marketplaces globally, with over 1.5 million animals finding new homes through our platforms every year. We are currently live in 5 different countries (UK, Sweden, Netherlands, Italy and Spain), despite only having launched 2 years ago. Here is an example of one of our apps: Pets4Homes.co.uk

The way pets find new loving homes has virtually remained the same for centuries, and we are on a mission to make that process more trusted, safe and convenient through innovative technology. We’re a young and ambitious team who have built unicorns in the past (e.g. Avito) and we are backed by some of Europe’s leading investors (e.g. Verdane and Otiva) who are early investors in leading companies such as Klarna, NA-KD, Apotea and Desenio.

Who are we looking for?

As a Front-end Developer, we expect you to be driven with an eye for detail. We expect our Front-end Developers to be experts when it comes to creating appealing user interfaces and experiences, but also open minded enough to think about how to best solve the complex challenges of our users (and their pets!)

We’re looking for someone with roughly 3 years of experience in javascript-based technologies (see further down for our current tech stack).

As a person, we love to meet those who do not shy away from big challenges and solving new problems. Growing fast is exciting, and requires us to always be curious and constantly wanting to learn new things.

A strong proficiency in Javascript is however necessary.

Bonus points for prior experience with:

Building apps with React, Next.js & React Native
Understanding of GraphQL and its usage in large systems with multiple consumers
Experience with frontend testing tools and testing strategies
Understanding of SEO and other web vital metrics

While this is a Front-End role, you might be expected to jump in and do some minor changes on the back-end. Should you consider yourself to be a full-stack developer, then you are of course more than welcome to apply as well!

We expect all candidates to have working proficiency in English.

Our tech stack

Next.js, React, Node.js & ReactNative (Typescript it is)
Gitlab runners CI/CD
Elasticsearch
Redis
GraphQL & PostgreSQL
Docker
Serverless architecture with AWS Lambda

We launched in January 2017 and since attracted 190k+ of the most talented creatives around the globe and hundreds of high profile organizations and brands. We’re a focused and lean, yet very effective team based in Germany, UK, USA, India, Brazil and Indonesia – we communicate in English only.

This role is for you if you have extensive experience in developing, shipping, maintaining and operating scalable and secure applications both in front- and backend. You’re self-organized and you know how to set and communicate priorities in order to achieve objectives. You know how to manage yourself, ideally you proved that by running your own business or side project. You’re excited about learning and sharing your knowledge with your team. You’re obsessed about quality and have pleasure in automating repetitive tasks.

We work almost entirely in Typescript. Our web apps are built in React (lately with Next.js) and backends are running in Node with Postgres.

The Role
Develop a deep understanding of our products, customers, goals, organization and business strategies, evaluating systems and processes, and identifying improvement needs
Collaborate with our product manager and designer to prioritize and commit on building, shipping and validating product features
Write and own maintainable code, while defining and improving long-term health of surrounding systems
Advocate for codebase and pattern changes to improve developer experience
Manage and oversee internal standards for style, maintainability, and best practices through code review
Automate! We’re a small team with high output. Test-automation is key to maintain continuous delivery of value to our users. We are doing ok in this area, but there’s still a lot to gain.
Constantly learn and improve. 10% of our time is reserved for learning and another 10% for improving internal processes (automation, testing, developer experience, infrastructure and code maintainability etc.)

Requirements
3+ years experience developing backend architecture and RESTful APIs with minimal guidance (bonus: experience with GraphQL backends)
3+ years experience developing frontend applications with React (bonus: experience with Next.js)
Proven track record of juggling multiple projects and hitting deadlines
Demonstrated capacity to clearly communicate about complex technical, architectural, and/or organizational problems and propose solutions
A positive attitude, a sense of humor and a desire to build accessible products for all users
Familiarity with some or all of the following technologies
Node.js
React & Next.js
Typescript
AWS
Postgres
Infrastructure-as-Code (we use Pulumi)
End-to-end test tooling (e.g. Cypress)
Docker

Benefits
Our company culture is built around a tireless pursuit to be the best at what we do.
We're entrepreneurial and focused: tackling problems head-on without ego.
We communicate with empathy. We speak directly, listen thoughtfully, and ask questions.
We highly value each other's time in order to maximize our impact. To achieve this, we do extensive research and write specifications before building, invest in automation, and practice efficient and deliberate communication. We believe it is important to have long stretches of uninterrupted focus time, so we keep meetings to a minimum. On average, you will not have more than 2 hours of meetings per week, including a 1:1.
Our headquarter is based in Munich, Germany, but we’re a fully remote company. This is a remote role. While you can live and work wherever you want, at least 6h of your working hours should happen from 9 to 5 in Central European time (UTC+1).
We embrace learning and experimentation. We encourage you to use 10% of your working hours to learn and experiment with new technology, read mind blowing books and blogs or do online courses.
We respect your personal life and provide a family friendly working environment. While we love what we’re doing and are very dedicated to our jobs and the company, we still know what really matters: family and friends. Most of us have kids and share care work equally with our partners, so we know what we’re talking about ;)
20 paid vacation days + public German holidays (to keep organization simple)
32h work week (most of us work on 4 days, some split their off day into two half days, but that’s up to you)
A fair salary + Virtual Employee Stock Ownership Plans (VSOPs)

At Picter, we believe that it takes a diversity of thought, culture, race, sexual orientation, and outlook to build a world-class business. We value unique contributions and welcome people of all backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives to join us."

I’m excited to open this position because it has many responsibilities I want as an engineer. As a product engineer, you’ll take ownership over a large portion of one of our products and own projects end-to-end (wearing hats traditionally worn by product and design). You’ll, for example, research competitors, write product specs, and implement features from frontend to backend. To ground it with examples, product engineers at Ashby have:
Designed and built automated candidate scheduling. This feature automates scheduling by calculating possible times from a pool of interviewers and presenting these times to the candidate for selection via our responsive web app.
Built a generalized filter architecture that allows users to create complex filters for any record with a consistent UI and compile it to SQL in our backend. Many user-facing features use it.
Spec-ed, designed, and implemented a feature that allows users to complete the process of signing offers entirely within Ashby. This project involved talking to customers to understand their requirements, deciding what technologies to use, building a prototype, and working with other team members to integrate the final implementation into additional features.

These projects reflect what we’re accomplishing at Ashby: improving the productivity of working professionals (starting with talent teams) with intelligent and powerful software. We put a lot of effort into designing products that are approachable to beginners but mastered & extended by power users. In many ways, spreadsheets set the bar here.

We have many customers, great revenue growth, years of runway, and amazing investors like YCombinator, Elad Gil, and Lachy Groom. I’ll share more once we meet.

One formality, we do require at least 8 years of experience as a full-time software engineer for this role.

Engineering Culture

Our engineering culture is motivated by Benji’s (my co-founder and CEO) and my belief that a small talented team, given the right environment, can build high-quality software fast (and work regular hours!).

Collaboration is Natural & Communication is Deliberate

Our engineering team (and the team at large) consists of lifelong learners who are humble and kind (meet them here!). These attributes create an environment where collaboration happens naturally (we filter for it in interviews). We combine this with research, prototyping, and written proposals to see around corners and get feedback from the team across time zones. Focus time is something that we hold sacred, and, with thoughtful and deliberate communication, engineers can focus 36h out of a 40h work week (I wrote about it here).

Increase Leverage, not Team Size

We built Ashby with the quality, breadth, and depth that many customers would expect from much larger teams over larger time scales. We’ve done this through investment in:
Great developer tooling. Our CI/CD takes ~10m, and we deploy at least 10x a day. Everyone on the team has contributed to developer experience 💪🏾
Building blocks to create powerful and customizable products fast. At the core of Ashby is a set of common components (analytics modeling and query language, policy engine, workflow engine, design system) which we are constantly improving. Each improvement to a common component cascades throughout our app (short video below).

Here’s an impromptu quote from Arjun in our company Slack of what it’s like to build a feature at Ashby:

And a demo of one of these building blocks:

Give Engineers Ownership & Autonomy

We, as engineers, find clever ways to solve problems, which amplifies when we deeply understand the problem. Benji and I did our best work as engineers when we had a deep understanding of the end-user and the business and ownership over the solution. Our engineering culture reflects this experience: engineers own projects end-to-end, from speaking with users to writing product specs to UX design. These are skills that we often don’t get to practice as engineers, and, at Ashby, we provide mentorship to grow them and help from the team where you want it.

Put Effort into Diversity

Diverse teams drive innovation and better outcomes. Having seen my mother and partner build their careers as minority women in non-diverse fields, I want to make sure Ashby creates opportunities for the next generation of engineers from underrepresented groups.

Today, 26% of engineers at Ashby are from underrepresented groups. It’s not great, and we are taking conscious steps to improve, like sourcing diverse candidates, providing generous paid family leave, no leetcode interviews, and more.

Interview Process

At Ashby, our team and interview process want to help you show your best self. We’ll dive into past projects and simulate working together via pair programming, writing tech specs collaboratively, and talking through decisions (no leetcode or whiteboard exercises). Our interview process is three rounds:
30-minute introduction call (we demo Ashby!)
A technical screen (take home or 75-minute in-person)
A virtual on-site of 3 hours and 30 minutes (can be split across two days)

Your hiring manager will be your main point of contact and prep you for interviews. You’ll meet my co-founder and CEO plus 4 to 6 people in engineering (with 15 minutes in each interview to ask them questions). If we don’t give an offer, we’ll provide feedback!

Your First Two Months at Ashby

We want an exceptional onboarding experience for every new hire. At Ashby, your dev environment sets up with a single script, you push your first change on day one, and we spend the rest of the time building your confidence in our codebase and practices culminating in the delivery of a prominent, impactful feature. We’ll pair you with a peer who’ll guide you through your first tasks and be someone you rely on, from answering questions to pair programming.

Technology Stack

I’m sharing our tech stack with the caveat that we don’t require previous experience in it (but a love of typed languages is helpful 😀): TypeScript (frontend & backend), Node.js, React, Apollo GraphQL, Postgres, Redis.

Benefits
Competitive salary and equity.
10-year exercise window for stock options. You shouldn’t feel pressure to purchase stock options if you leave Ashby —do it when you feel financially comfortable.
Unlimited PTO with four weeks recommended per year. Expect “Vacation?” in our one-on-one agenda until you start taking it 😅.
Twelve weeks of fully paid family leave in the US. We plan to expand this to employees in other countries as situations arise.
Generous equipment, software, and office furniture budget. Get what you need to be happy and productive!
$100/month education budget with more expensive items (like conferences) covered with manager approval.
If you’re in the US, top-notch health insurance for you and your dependents with all premiums covered by us.

Ashby’s success hinges on hiring great people and creating an environment where we can be happy, feel challenged, and do our best work. We’re being deliberate about building that environment from the ground up. I hope that excites you enough to apply.

Ashby provides equal employment opportunities (EEO) to all employees and applicants for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, genetics, sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression. We are committed to a diverse and inclusive workforce and welcome people from all backgrounds, experiences, perspectives, and abilities.
