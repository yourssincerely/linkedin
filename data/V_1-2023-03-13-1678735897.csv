About Us:

Consensus is a top place to work due to the incredible culture our employees have created. We strive to provide an opportunity to work with a great team with a compelling product with the objective that adding value in your work life fuels the rest of your life. We know that a winning company is built on the efforts of its people, and that’s an environment we foster at Consensus. We encourage every employee to bring their authentic self to work and take ownership of their position and their career. We strive to give our employees everything they need to make meaningful contributions to the overall success of our company. We’re looking for go-getters that are excited to thrive in a company going through an exciting growth phase!

We are a fast-growing SaaS company based in the United States. We are changing the way the world buys enterprise software. We do this by providing intelligent demo automation software that helps you scale Presales. How does this work?

We believe buying enterprise software should be simple, pleasant, and fast instead of complex, painful, and slow (which is how it is today). Buyers now want instant access to presales (sales engineering) resources throughout the buying experience but they find it harder and harder to get what they need. Using Consensus, a sales engineering team builds a library of reusable interactive video demos that Sales sends out on-demand. Consensus automatically personalizes the experience and tracks engagement as the prospect shares the demo with other stakeholders in the buying group, bringing the entire buying group to live demos better educated and ready to talk specifics.

This not only reduces unqualified demos to near zero and can double the presales team’s productivity, it also removes the ""demo lag time"" for prospects and shortens the sales cycle by as much as 68%.

Our Values:

Our values are extremely important to us and we hope that they mean something to you too. We want everyone to bring their authentic selves to work every day. We hope you can help us continue to grow without having to be perfect, but willing to put your name on something knowing it is a “version one”. Everyone here takes total ownership and accountability, because owning our outcomes means making a real contribution. We also believe in a “no peacemongering” principle. We know our path to success is hard and we don’t hesitate to ask hard things of others. We are respectfully confrontational to one another and ask direct accountability questions.

Check out all of our values on our careers page !

The Role

We are looking for a virtual PMO Group Leader that will be part of the management team of the Solera Global Project Management Office (PMO) and lead a team of project management professionals that will specifically have a focus on projects related to products that Solera markets to its clientele internationally (i.e., outside of North America).

In addition, the PMO Group Leader will establish a hierarchical project management structure that will facilitate multiple levels of project status reporting and issue escalation including, at minimum, project, portfolio, and group level. As such it is critical that the PMO Group Leader is highly skilled, experienced, and competent in acting in a group-level oversight role of multiple project portfolios and thus can act in an effective role of oversight, advisement, selective intervention to assist in issue resolution where needed, and as a final point of escalation of issues within the group to attempt to resolve with escalation further up the management chain only on rare occasion when necessary. These job requirements necessitate an individual with several years of successful hand-on experience in managing projects consisting of varying business needs, technologies, stakeholders, levels of complexity, and problem-solving. The PMO Group Leader will require a history of competency and accomplishment in the exact roles of the team members, as they will depend on their manager for expert-level guidance, direction, advisement, and support in successfully managing their own projects. The PMO Group Leader’s overall mission is to manage a group that consistently demonstrates and is reputable in an ability to deliver critical projects of various types, meeting business expectations, and most importantly successfully delivering the intended and expected results, with solid communication and transparency every step of the way.

Be able to speak in a thorough, substantive, and accurate manner about the projects under the group’s management responsibility and serve as an effective point of communication of status, as well as escalation of issues to leadership outside the group as needed
Act as an effective backstop for issue resolution and problem-solving related to projects under management responsibility of the group, ensuring that escalations beyond the group on only on rare occasion – the PMO Group Leader should be able to advise, direct, and assist as needed to resolve the majority of issues that are raised for any given project
Collaborate with other PMO leadership to formulate new processes, reengineer existing ones, as well as define and propagate best practices and standard procedures related to project management across Solera
Collaborate with other PMO leadership as needed to establish an effective management model for PMO resource sharing and cross-utilization, as well as resource accountability not only to their direct manager but also a dotted line to their stakeholders (e.g., portfolio managers, product managers, etc.)
Act as a point of escalation for stakeholders regarding any projects within the management responsibility of the group
Serve in administrative management capacity to team members, collaborating and advising them in career planning and management, as well as performance evaluations, and recognition of accomplishments

What You’ll Bring
Bachelor's degree (BS/BA) in a related field of study; Masters in a related field is a plus
10+ years experience of project, program, and project portfolio management experience, particularly in software and information technology in a wide breadth of size & complexity

Base decisions and judgments strictly on facts – not conjecture, supposition, or hearsay – and perform the legwork to get the facts needed for every situation
Resolve conflict or disagreement among team members, peers, management, stakeholders in a respectful fashion and with the perspectives in mind of not just yourself but of all those involved
Be proactive in problem-solving; treating risk management as the key to minimal problems, obstacles, & blockers that can occur in project execution and teach the team to think and to act in that fashion and modeling the behavior for them
Be accountable, trustworthy, direct, and objective in fulfillment of job expectations, deliverables, performance, and results of the team that they are in charge of
Be able to operate and thrive in an environment that is challenging and can change frequently with aggressive objectives to meet and complex problems to overcome
Manage employees in a fair, consistent, transparent, objective, and constructive fashion, with a genuine interest and investment in their success and career growth, as well as the benefit of your years of experience and insight
Be process oriented and recognize the importance of standardization for repeatability, consistency, and maturity of our project management capabilities across the organization

👪 Team and environment

We are looking for an Application Security Engineer to join Romain in the technical security team. Reporting directly to Guillaume, our Head of Information Security, you will be responsible for all technical matters involving security issues. Working with the security compliance team, you may be required to provide technical support to the team in the definition and monitoring of long-term projects designed to strengthen the security of our assets in a sustainable manner. You will have a key role in advising, assisting, informing, training and alerting all employees (especially developers). You will also be responsible for the day-to-day management of technical operations in the context of ISO 27001 certification.

The technical security team is involved from the identification/detection of a security issue to its resolution (development and implementation of the security patches). If the needs or the complexity of the patch are too great, the security team can count on the support of the developers and in particular the Security Champions team to sustain the effort.

🎯 Your tasks

You Will Be Required To Work On

All technical security issues/projects while providing technical support on compliance needs

Let’s Break It Down
Security by design within the projects by discussing with the teams to consider the security risks
To be proactive in the security projects to be carried out, to define and to prioritize them
Ensure the security of the main Web application in Ruby on Rails and React: its dependencies, its code, its infrastructure and its configuration
Security and maintaining the security condition of other applications and AWS infrastructure, including its Kubernetes environment (AWS EKS)
Conduct and perform regular security assessments (internally or by an external firm) on the applications (code reviews/pentests/bug bounty in particular) and the infrastructure
Conducting code reviews from a secure development point of view (about 80 releases per day, not all of which have security implications, but it is an important and recurring topic)
Build/Improve secure development training materials and conduct regular training sessions with the developers
Contribute to tenders to explain our security policies and provide the necessary technical details
Learn about Rails and React to detect vulnerabilities during code reviews and implement associated patches
Strengthen the current means of detecting malicious attempts
These missions are not exhaustive and remain evolving.
🥇You’re the right candidate if
You have just graduated or ideally have a first experience in defensive or offensive application security, are a quick learner and like to work on different projects. As a security team member at Pennylane, you’ll work on all security topics (application, cloud infrastructure, security by design, training, ISO 27001, etc.).
Working in an English-speaking environment doesn't scare you, you don't need to be bilingual. You need to be able to share your ideas and thoughts well in spoken and written English and to understand what is being said. If you need help with this, we can provide you with a Busuu subscription to improve your English immediately.
You ideally have the following skills/experience:
Able to perform offensive security assessments on an infrastructure or an application
You know how to exploit and fix a wide range of Web vulnerabilities (not just the OWASP top 10)
You already have experience in a programming language (Ruby, Python, JavaScript), either for quick and dirty scripting to exploit a vulnerability or for larger projects
You have experience in cloud infrastructure security
You are able to popularize technical terms to facilitate the adoption of security measures within projects or to broadcast messages to Pennylaners
You are autonomous, proactive and organized
Working with remote colleagues is not an issue for you
Bonus: if you have already developed in Ruby or React and/or if you have technical application security certifications.

A multi-skilled profile will be preferred.

✨ Our vision
We aim to become the most beloved financial Operating System of European SMEs.
We help business owners get rid of the time consuming hassle of handling accounting and finance, while giving them access to key information that they can use to make better decisions.
Meanwhile, we’re helping accountants. By using Pennylane, rather than doing manual and repetitive tasks, they can spend more time advising and guiding their clients.

La société

Leur mission: rendre l'accès aux soins cardiaques de haut niveau accessible à tous, n'importe où, n'importe quand.

L'examen le plus courant pour diagnostiquer une arythmie est un électrocardiogramme (ECG) ambulatoire, qui enregistre l'activité électrique du cœur entre 1 et 30 jours, voire jusqu'à quelques années dans le cas des dispositifs implantables. Les grandes quantités de données générées par de tels tests nécessitent encore que les experts passent par un processus long et laborieux, ce qui entraîne des coûts élevés, des retards de traitement et une qualité variable.

Le poste

Vous serez garant de l'infrastructure de leurs produits qui sont utilisés pour rationaliser le diagnostic de plusieurs milliers de patients quotidiennement, sur quatre continents différents.

Vous approfondirez également les sujets techniques liés à la haute disponibilité, à la surveillance des performances et aux améliorations ou encore à la sécurité.

🚀 Whatnot

Whatnot (YC W20) is a livestream shopping platform and marketplace backed by Andreessen Horowitz and Y Combinator. We’re one of YC’s top companies and one of the fastest growing marketplaces ever. We’re laser focused on creating an exceptional software company, team, and place to work.

Our mission: enable anyone to turn their passion into a business and bring people together through commerce. We’re building the future of ecommerce; an interactive community where creators can make a living off their passion.

Did we mention we’re high growth? In January 2021, Whatnot had 10 ambitious employees. Today, the Whatnot team is 160+ employees and will exceed 300 by year end. We’re hiring forward-thinking problem solvers across all functional areas. We recruit thoughtfully, can adapt quickly, and are scaling fully remotely .

📈 Opportunity Size

The e-commerce experience has been static for 20+ years and is one of the largest opportunities for disruption in the startup space today. Livestream shopping is a $300B GMV market in China and has grown 100% YoY. Retail is a $5T market opportunity!

💻 The role

Payments at Whatnot makes the money flow, and orders happen. The team’s scope is large, encompassing pay, fraud & shipping. Engineers own these entire flows from experience, to vendor integrations, to inhouse infrastructure. Last year we moved >$150m through these pipelines and shipped millions of products to users and this year we’re aiming to 10x those numbers.

To achieve these goals, we’re looking to make a number of substantial improvements to our systems and customer experiences including critical areas of the business like payment scale & reliability, increased payment options, fraud mitigation, advanced shipping options, and improved delivery times and bringing Whatnot to hundreds of millions more customers.

We’re looking for capable iOS engineers with a proven track record for building slick UI's that people love. Whatnot is growing very rapidly, so you must be able to deal with the pressure/growth that comes with a high-growth environment. You will be working in a high-growth startup, wearing multiple hats.
Build native iOS applications in Swift.
Build intuitive user interfaces from the ground up.
Create modifiable, maintainable, and well-tested code.
Investigate and solve issues with bugs and data inconsistencies.
Improve the availability and performance of current systems.
Work with the engineering team to define implementation strategy, define overall requirements, and redefine a product, if needed.

👋 About You

3+ years of software engineering experience.
2+ years of experience writing production iOS apps.
Expert in Swift - Interest in SwiftUI a bonus!
Experience writing readable, maintainable, and scalable code
Strong attention to detail. Whatnot operates without a product team, giving engineering full reign of the product.
Constantly strives to push yourself and the team forward through technical and intellectual rigor.
Self-starter. You will be able to hit the ground running with little direction.
Startup experience at a high-growth company is a major plus.

🎁 Benefits

A workplace run on trust, empowerment and feedback.
Competitive base salary and stock options in a hugely successful, Series company
Unlimited Vacation Policy and Company-wide Holidays (including a spring and winter break)

Your mission: Help put together the most talent-intensive team on the planet.

Since launching in 2013, Bending Spoons has served around half a billion people across the globe through our suite of cutting-edge products. Still, we’ve only just crossed the starting line on our mission to make an enduring positive impact on our customers, on our fellow Spooners, and on society at large.

At the heart of our success are the bright people who make up the Spooniverse. Here, ‌talent density is continuously rising—thanks to our uncompromising focus on finding the world's most promising potential new Spooners. It's a focus so crucial to everything we do, even our CEO is on the talent assessment team.

Now, more than ever, it’s important that we keep raising the bar on our hiring expectations and on our approach to talent acquisition. Even as corporate decision-making becomes increasingly science-based, the most critical decisions relating to people are still too often made arbitrarily. And as companies grow, they tend to lower their standards in a rush to fill positions. We’re determined to do things differently.

So we’re looking for someone as committed as we are to putting together the most talent-intensive team on the planet. If you’re extremely analytical and creative, if you have high standards and steadfast perseverance, we’d love to hear from you.

A few examples of your responsibilities:
Drive impact. Reach, assess, and select the most promising talents for consideration at a talent-driven company.
Do meaningful work. With technology and AI automating menial tasks, you’ll focus on the areas where human reasoning, awareness, and consideration are essential and cannot be replaced.
Own the decisions. From the start of a candidate’s journey to when they’re presented to the hiring committee, determine the best next step at every point. Work with extreme independence and trust in managing the positions you’re filling.
Defy complacency. Good enough is never good enough here. The quality of your decisions can help skyrocket the company to never-before-reached levels of success.
Stand out. Help set a new standard for impactful employer brand management and deliver an astonishingly positive candidate experience.

What we look for
Drive. You’re energetic and hard-working, and you persevere through adversity until the job is done—and done impeccably. You’re massively into getting results.
Reasoning and depth of learning. You’re structured and creative enough to solve most challenging problems independently, given the necessary knowledge.
Common sense. Your judgment and intuition are sound and well grounded in reality.
Pragmatism. Far from being too academic or obsessive in your perfectionism, you understand that speed is often as important as quality when getting things done in a competitive world.
Accuracy and precision. Your attention to detail is spot-on, and you’re painstakingly accurate.
Tenacity. Once you have a goal, there’s no stopping you! Failure doesn’t discourage you—after every stumble, you get right back up and try again.
Humility. You’re down-to-earth, eager to listen to feedback and constructive criticism, and ready to support your team with whatever it needs to succeed.
Proficiency in English. You read, write, and speak proficiently in English.

What we offer
Make a difference. Be the owner of your effort—from day one, you’re one of the team and fully trusted to take responsibility for your tasks. You’ll have every incentive to make a major impact.
Real impact. We automate most menial tasks, freeing you up to focus your expertise where it can make the biggest impact.
Unique career opportunity. By joining a fast-growing company on a mission to become one of the world's greatest, it’s an unparalleled opportunity to turbocharge your learning and career prospects.
Continuous education. Spooners get unlimited backing for learning investments, including Italian or English lessons and things like courses, conferences, and books. There’s no permission or approval process—you’re fully trusted to use the company’s resources efficiently.
Talented, knowledgeable colleagues. Learn from (and teach) some of the brightest and most skilled people you’ll ever meet. Your talent is going to blossom here.
People who lift up one another. We hire for talent and leave the ego at the door. You'll find a group of truly talented Spooners who are eager to teach their secrets and to learn. Reciprocal support and respect is everything—you’re unlikely to ever encounter a more harmonious crew.
Competitive salary and stock options. Our compensation package is highly competitive, and can grow rapidly and include stock options, depending on your performance and seniority.
Wonderful HQ. Natural light, silent rooms, state-of-the-art hardware, fun-filled common spaces... the list never ends! You’ll certainly be in the right environment to do your best work. And, when it’s time to switch off, you can do that in style and comfort.
Remote working. Spend as much or as little time in our Milan office as you choose. Many Spooners like to change up their environment and get out of the city whenever the mood strikes. You’ve always got the freedom to decide where today’s office is.
Exciting events. We care deeply about team spirit and bonding. That’s why our incredible People Operations team organizes awesome events, like team games, drinks, yoga classes, parties, and regular company-wide retreats. Recent destinations include Bali, Mauritius, and Tanzania.

Commitment & contract
Full-time. Permanent, fixed-term, or internship, depending on seniority.

Location
Milan, Italy or fully remote.
If you choose the on-site option, it’s fine if you prefer to work remotely sometimes. We offer substantial support for relocation, including finding an apartment in Milan and paying the rent for 12 weeks.

The selection process
If you successfully pass through our screening process, we’ll invite you to take on a few tests that assess how you approach and solve unfamiliar problems. If you’re successful there, we’ll invite you to take part in some interviews. We welcome applications in English and Italian.

Bending Spoons is an equal opportunity and affirmative action employer. We consider for employment all applicants and we provide reasonable accommodations for candidates with disabilities, which can be requested at accommodations-ext@bendingspoons.com.

Studies suggest that women tend not to apply for a job if their CV isn’t a perfect fit. Here, we look for talent and potential—not just experience and expertise. So if you like the role and think you could be awesome at it, go ahead and apply."

Your mission: Help put together the most talent-intensive team on the planet.

Since launching in 2013, Bending Spoons has served around half a billion people across the globe through our suite of cutting-edge products. Still, we’ve only just crossed the starting line on our mission to make an enduring positive impact on our customers, on our fellow Spooners, and on society at large.

At the heart of our success are the bright people who make up the Spooniverse. Here, ‌talent density is continuously rising—thanks to our uncompromising focus on finding the world's most promising potential new Spooners. It's a focus so crucial to everything we do, even our CEO is on the talent assessment team.

Now, more than ever, it’s important that we keep raising the bar on our hiring expectations and on our approach to talent acquisition. Even as corporate decision-making becomes increasingly science-based, the most critical decisions relating to people are still too often made arbitrarily. And as companies grow, they tend to lower their standards in a rush to fill positions. We’re determined to do things differently.

So we’re looking for someone as committed as we are to putting together the most talent-intensive team on the planet. If you’re extremely analytical and creative, if you have high standards and steadfast perseverance, we’d love to hear from you.

A few examples of your responsibilities:
Drive impact. Reach, assess, and select the most promising talents for consideration at a talent-driven company.
Do meaningful work. With technology and AI automating menial tasks, you’ll focus on the areas where human reasoning, awareness, and consideration are essential and cannot be replaced.
Own the decisions. From the start of a candidate’s journey to when they’re presented to the hiring committee, determine the best next step at every point. Work with extreme independence and trust in managing the positions you’re filling.
Defy complacency. Good enough is never good enough here. The quality of your decisions can help skyrocket the company to never-before-reached levels of success.
Stand out. Help set a new standard for impactful employer brand management and deliver an astonishingly positive candidate experience.

What we look for
Drive. You’re energetic and hard-working, and you persevere through adversity until the job is done—and done impeccably. You’re massively into getting results.
Reasoning and depth of learning. You’re structured and creative enough to solve most challenging problems independently, given the necessary knowledge.
Common sense. Your judgment and intuition are sound and well grounded in reality.
Pragmatism. Far from being too academic or obsessive in your perfectionism, you understand that speed is often as important as quality when getting things done in a competitive world.
Accuracy and precision. Your attention to detail is spot-on, and you’re painstakingly accurate.
Tenacity. Once you have a goal, there’s no stopping you! Failure doesn’t discourage you—after every stumble, you get right back up and try again.
Humility. You’re down-to-earth, eager to listen to feedback and constructive criticism, and ready to support your team with whatever it needs to succeed.
Proficiency in English. You read, write, and speak proficiently in English.

What we offer
Make a difference. Be the owner of your effort—from day one, you’re one of the team and fully trusted to take responsibility for your tasks. You’ll have every incentive to make a major impact.
Real impact. We automate most menial tasks, freeing you up to focus your expertise where it can make the biggest impact.
Unique career opportunity. By joining a fast-growing company on a mission to become one of the world's greatest, it’s an unparalleled opportunity to turbocharge your learning and career prospects.
Continuous education. Spooners get unlimited backing for learning investments, including Italian or English lessons and things like courses, conferences, and books. There’s no permission or approval process—you’re fully trusted to use the company’s resources efficiently.
Talented, knowledgeable colleagues. Learn from (and teach) some of the brightest and most skilled people you’ll ever meet. Your talent is going to blossom here.
People who lift up one another. We hire for talent and leave the ego at the door. You'll find a group of truly talented Spooners who are eager to teach their secrets and to learn. Reciprocal support and respect is everything—you’re unlikely to ever encounter a more harmonious crew.
Competitive salary and stock options. Our compensation package is highly competitive, and can grow rapidly and include stock options, depending on your performance and seniority.
Wonderful HQ. Natural light, silent rooms, state-of-the-art hardware, fun-filled common spaces... the list never ends! You’ll certainly be in the right environment to do your best work. And, when it’s time to switch off, you can do that in style and comfort.
Remote working. Spend as much or as little time in our Milan office as you choose. Many Spooners like to change up their environment and get out of the city whenever the mood strikes. You’ve always got the freedom to decide where today’s office is.
Exciting events. We care deeply about team spirit and bonding. That’s why our incredible People Operations team organizes awesome events, like team games, drinks, yoga classes, parties, and regular company-wide retreats. Recent destinations include Bali, Mauritius, and Tanzania.

Commitment & contract
Full-time. Permanent, fixed-term, or internship, depending on seniority.

Location
Milan, Italy or fully remote.
If you choose the on-site option, it’s fine if you prefer to work remotely sometimes. We offer substantial support for relocation, including finding an apartment in Milan and paying the rent for 12 weeks.

The selection process
If you successfully pass through our screening process, we’ll invite you to take on a few tests that assess how you approach and solve unfamiliar problems. If you’re successful there, we’ll invite you to take part in some interviews. We welcome applications in English and Italian.

Bending Spoons is an equal opportunity and affirmative action employer. We consider for employment all applicants and we provide reasonable accommodations for candidates with disabilities, which can be requested at accommodations-ext@bendingspoons.com.

Studies suggest that women tend not to apply for a job if their CV isn’t a perfect fit. Here, we look for talent and potential—not just experience and expertise. So if you like the role and think you could be awesome at it, go ahead and apply."

Position Overview

Our customers are at the forefront of some of the most interesting data in the world, using SingleStore to push the boundaries every day. To do this well, they leverage the expertise of our Support Engineering Team, composed of technical subject matter experts on the frontlines of critical customer issues.

This Support Engineering role skews far more towards engineering than typical technical support as you will need to delve into database internals and memory allocators, diagnose complex SQL query behavior, and investigate Linux and Kubernetes related configurations, all in the name of resolving complex product issues. Our Support Engineers are constantly learning a wide range of customer systems and technical concepts and are thrilled by the new and exciting challenges that they encounter each day.

To accurately identify the source and solution of an issue, this team will take the time to learn about the customer’s business and systems while helping to improve their fundamental SingleStore and database operational knowledge. This often requires additional research and time spent on learning new technologies and tools outside of just the database engine while also being deeply engaged with multiple departments including development teams, query performance engineering, product management, infrastructure SREs, etc.

Role And Responsibilities

Provide product support to our on-premise and cloud hosted enterprise customers, acting as the first-line-of-defense for complex technical issues, bug diagnosis, or resolving critical outages.
Identify and reproduce product issues and submit formal bug reports or feature requests to the appropriate Engineering team.
Understand and help to improve complex SQL behavior to diagnose bugs or improve performance.
Collaborate with software developers, sales engineers, and technical account managers to keep all teams up to date with current issues a customer may be facing.
Work to streamline and improve various Support and Engineering processes and tools, author new knowledge base articles and run-books, and help the team continually improve efficiency and effectiveness.
Participate in our on-call rotation that may include weekends and holidays.

Required Skills And Experience

4+ years of previous customer-facing advanced technical support experience.
Previous experience as a DBA or Support Engineer at a database company.
Experience with SQL databases and advanced SQL query optimization and tuning. You should be familiar enough with at least one commercial or open source database to decipher its EXPLAIN plan and understand potential performance impact or ways to improve the query.
Strong background in general product troubleshooting, keeping in mind that query processing issues can be impacted by database or linux configuration and resource availability.
A solid linux performance background. That means you are hands-on with Linux and your skills include generating and reading flame graphs, checking system resource utilization, and parsing verbose log files. Bonus points for familiarity with Kubernetes.
Experience with a scripting or coding language. Whether it’s C++, Python, Go, or Bash, you should have a go-to solution for quick problem-solving and be able to navigate through our extensive code base.
Familiarity with distributed systems and AWS/GCP. You understand how organizations deploy and maintain distributed applications and services across multiple machines and know how to analyze these systems for performance bottlenecks.
Experience improving support processes regarding ticket triage, escalation, and reporting business metrics back to the organization.
Strong written and verbal English communication skills. Have the ability to explain technical concepts to a wide range of end-users.

SingleStore is one platform for all data, built so you can engage with insight in every moment. Trusted by industry leaders, SingleStore enables enterprises to adapt to change as it happens, embrace diverse data with ease, and accelerate the pace of innovation. SingleStore is venture-backed and headquartered in San Francisco with offices in Portland, Seattle, Boston, Bangalore, London, Lisbon, and Kyiv. Defining the future starts with The Database of Now™.

Consistent with our commitment to diversity & inclusion, we value individuals with the ability to work on diverse teams and with a diverse range of people.

To all recruitment agencies: SingleStore does not accept agency resumes. Please do not forward resumes to SingleStore employees. SingleStore is not responsible for any fees related to unsolicited resumes and will not pay fees to any third-party agency or company that does not have a signed agreement with the Company.

Docker is a remote first company with employees across Europe and the Americas that simplifies the lives of developers who are making world-changing apps. We raised our Series C funding in March 2022 for $105M at a $2.1B valuation. We continued to see exponential revenue growth last year. Join us for a whale of a ride!

About Us

Docker is a remote first company with employees across Europe and the Americas. We value transparency and asynchronous communication, but also arrange meetups and offsites to allow people to work together in person.

At Docker, we empower developers to make world-changing apps. Docker helps developers bring their ideas to reality by conquering the complexity of app development using container images. The Supply Chain team is looking to solve the following problems:
What insights can we give developers about their images and build processes?
How can developers keep their software dependencies up to date and secure?
What data can we put at developers' fingertips to supercharge their daily work?
How can developers build on expertise and pre-existing solutions within their organization?

To solve these problems, the Supply Chain team experiments on and delivers various features using data, iterating quickly on prototypes inside Docker Desktop, Docker Hub, and a new cross-registry initiative. We’re centered around a large data plane with integrations to container registries and source control systems. We use this data to provide developers with insights and new functionality.

Who We’re Looking For

Description

Who We Are

Firebolt is a disruptor in the data & analytics space. Based on technology that delivers an order-of-magnitude performance leap in TB-scale analytics, Firebolt helps the most data-forward companies create a new wave of data & analytics experiences for end-users. With a team of world-class data experts, led by leadership veterans from Looker, Google BigQuery, Imply and Sisense, and backed by $264M in funding - we are growing quickly and are poised to build the data platform of the future, and set a new bar for what can be done with data.

The Team

At the heart of any modern SQL database lies the query compiler. The query compiler takes the user-provided SQL query, parses it, and then transforms it into a representation the database runtime can understand. Along this path, a variety of optimizations such as predicate placement and join reordering are performed.

Firebolt’s planner team owns this core component of our cloud-based data warehouse. The team is responsible for making sure our SQL dialect is loved by our customers, and that we are able to transform our customer’s queries into fast execution plans for our multi-threaded, distributed runtime.

The Role

As a senior compiler engineer in our planner team, you help shape the direction of our SQL planner. You work on new optimization rules, SQL features, and contribute to the performance and robustness of our state-of-the-art planner.

You will work closely with other database teams at Firebolt, such as storage and query execution, to seek out and drive novel optimization opportunities for our planner. Examples include further optimizing our distributed query plans, or integrating additional metadata into the planner.

Requirements

Must Have
Bachelor’s/Master’s/PhD in Computer Science, Engineering, or a related field, or equivalent experience
Fluency in a modern programming language, all our database teams work with C++20
3+ years of experience with compilers or optimization, either as a researcher or in industry

Nice to Have
Previous experience with SQL compilers and query optimization
Previous experience with distributed data processing systems
Background in modern, high-performance C++"

About Us

Pet Media Group (PMG) is a Stockholm-based startup that acquires, launches and develops market-leading pet marketplaces globally, with over 1.5 million animals finding new homes through our platforms every year. We are currently live in 5 different countries (UK, Sweden, Netherlands, Italy and Spain), despite only having launched 2 years ago. Here is an example of one of our apps: Pets4Homes.co.uk

The way pets find new loving homes has virtually remained the same for centuries, and we are on a mission to make that process more trusted, safe and convenient through innovative technology. We’re a young and ambitious team who have built unicorns in the past (e.g. Avito) and we are backed by some of Europe’s leading investors (e.g. Verdane and Otiva) who are early investors in leading companies such as Klarna, NA-KD, Apotea and Desenio.

Who are we looking for?

As a Front-end Developer, we expect you to be driven with an eye for detail. We expect our Front-end Developers to be experts when it comes to creating appealing user interfaces and experiences, but also open minded enough to think about how to best solve the complex challenges of our users (and their pets!)

We’re looking for someone with roughly 3 years of experience in javascript-based technologies (see further down for our current tech stack).

As a person, we love to meet those who do not shy away from big challenges and solving new problems. Growing fast is exciting, and requires us to always be curious and constantly wanting to learn new things.

Requirements

What skills do we expect you to have?

Being part of a fast-growing startup, we are looking for engineers who are not afraid to build fast, fail fast and learn from their mistakes. We do not expect you to be a world-class expert in all technologies used at PMG but we do expect you to be a fast learner and an engineer with a critical and open mindset. A strong proficiency in Javascript is however necessary.

Bonus points for prior experience with:

Building apps with React, Next.js & React Native
Understanding of GraphQL and its usage in large systems with multiple consumers
Experience with frontend testing tools and testing strategies
Understanding of SEO and other web vital metrics

While this is a Front-End role, you might be expected to jump in and do some minor changes on the back-end. Should you consider yourself to be a full-stack developer, then you are of course more than welcome to apply as well!

We expect all candidates to have working proficiency in English.

Our tech stack

Next.js, React, Node.js & ReactNative (Typescript it is)
Gitlab runners CI/CD
Elasticsearch
Redis
GraphQL & PostgreSQL
Docker
Serverless architecture with AWS Lambda
We are running on AWS
Customer issues tracking with Instabug
Bug tracking with Sentry
App release flow with Bitrise

What we offer

The ability to join a rapidly growing business with a clear vision, where passion and energy exists in abundance
A diverse team from various backgrounds - current team is located in Sweden, Germany, UK, Poland, Bosnia, Ukraine and Russia
A unique opportunity to become a part of a rapidly growing (but already profitable) start-up where you would be instrumental in building our Tech department

With tens of millions of active users and hundreds of thousands of daily downloads, we’re one of Europe’s leading app developers. We’re looking for a talented, and passionate native Android developer eager to help us make the best apps on the Play Store and contribute to improving our technology stack.

A few examples of your responsibilities
Write quality code that’s testable and maintainable. You understand the benefits of code that’s clean and idiomatic.
Follow best practices in terms of coding style, Git usage, commit messages, pull requests, and team conventions.
Perform code reviews and play an active part in tech discussions.
Work on apps, libraries, or tooling, depending on your skills and preferences.
Make proposals to improve our tech stack, libraries, and tooling.
Contribute to the product development of the apps you’ll work on. We’re all about taking a proactive role and ownership of your work.
Help define the software architecture of entire apps or new features—and then develop them. The work spans a broad range, from engineering and coding features to polishing world-class user interfaces.
Constantly improve the quality of our products by fixing bugs and refactoring the code base where necessary, as well as adding that wow factor to put smiles on our users’ faces.
Stay up-to-speed with new technologies (particularly on Android), and test the promising ones to make sure we don’t miss out on game-changing opportunities.

What we look for
Passion. You love what you do, and your enthusiasm never wavers with the specifics of a given task or team. Whether you’re on a plane, train, or sofa, odds are that you’ll be found with your nose in a book or article on the subject.
Reasoning and depth of learning. You’re structured and creative enough to solve most challenging problems independently, given the necessary knowledge. You learn new concepts and skills rapidly, and love to nerd out and go in-depth.
Accuracy and precision. Your attention to detail is spot-on, and you’re painstakingly accurate.
Logical-analytical abilities. You’re a quick learner who’s able to investigate and effectively pick up new concepts on your own. You can solve unforeseen challenges with creativity and structure, and can do so independently.
Drive. You’re energetic and hard-working, and you persevere through adversity until the job is done—and done impeccably. You’re massively into getting results, and always aim for excellence in what you do.
Curiosity and initiative. You love exploring, and are forever hunting down new opportunities and testing fresh ideas. Rather than waiting to be told what to do, you go seek.
Humility. You’re down to earth, eager to listen to feedback and constructive criticism, and ready to support your team with whatever it needs to succeed.
Proficiency in English. You read, write, and speak proficiently in English.

What we offer
Make a difference. Be the owner of your effort—from day one, you’re one of the team and fully trusted to take responsibility for your tasks. You’ll have every incentive to make a major impact.
International reach. We’re a global company, and your work will have worldwide exposure.
The finest tools. You get the best hardware on the market and all the software you could need. We can't wait to introduce you to our high-tech approach and our cutting-edge workflows.
Talented, knowledgeable colleagues. Learn from (and teach) some of the brightest and most skilled people you’ll ever meet. Your talent is going to blossom here.
Unique career opportunity. By joining a fast-growing company on a mission to become one of the world's greatest, it’s an unparalleled opportunity to turbocharge your learning and career prospects.
Continuous education. Spooners get unlimited backing for learning investments, including Italian or English lessons and things like courses, conferences, and books. There’s no permission or approval process—you’re fully trusted to use the company’s resources efficiently.
Wonderful HQ. Natural light, silent rooms, state-of-the-art hardware, fun-filled common spaces...the list never ends! You’ll certainly be in the right environment to do your best work. And, when it’s time to switch off, you can do that in style and comfort.
Remote working. Spend as much or as little time in our Milan office as you choose. Many Spooners like to change up their environment and get out of the city whenever the mood strikes. You’ve always got the freedom to decide where today’s office is.
Flexible schedule. Our regular hours are 9-6 GMT+1, but this isn’t a “clock in, clock out” company. You’re fully trusted to create the right conditions for your own personal peak productivity. We only ask that you’re available to your teammates a good chunk of the day (six hours or so). That’s why it’s generally best to be based somewhere with a similar time zone—between GMT-2 and GMT+3.
Competitive salary and stock options. Our compensation package is highly competitive, and can grow rapidly and include stock options, depending on your performance and seniority.

Commitment & contract
Fixed-term or internship.

Location
Milan, Italy or fully remote.
If you choose the on-site option, it’s fine if you prefer to work remotely sometimes. We offer substantial support for relocation, including finding an apartment in Milan and paying the rent for 12 weeks.

The selection process
If you successfully pass through our screening process, we’ll invite you to take on a few tests that assess how you approach and solve unfamiliar problems. If you’re successful there, we’ll invite you to take part in some interviews. We welcome applications in English and Italian.

Bending Spoons is an equal opportunity and affirmative action employer. We consider for employment all applicants and we provide reasonable accommodations for candidates with disabilities, which can be requested at accommodations-ext@bendingspoons.com.

Studies suggest that women tend not to apply for a job if their CV isn’t a perfect fit. Here, we look for talent and potential—not just experience and expertise. So if you like the role and think you could be awesome at it, go ahead and apply."

Position Overview

Our customers are at the forefront of some of the most interesting data in the world, using SingleStore to push the boundaries every day. To do this well, they leverage the expertise of our Support Engineering Team, composed of technical subject matter experts on the frontlines of critical customer issues.

This Support Engineering role skews far more towards engineering than typical technical support as you will need to delve into database internals and memory allocators, diagnose complex SQL query behavior, and investigate Linux and Kubernetes related configurations, all in the name of resolving complex product issues. Our Support Engineers are constantly learning a wide range of customer systems and technical concepts and are thrilled by the new and exciting challenges that they encounter each day.

To accurately identify the source and solution of an issue, this team will take the time to learn about the customer’s business and systems while helping to improve their fundamental SingleStore and database operational knowledge. This often requires additional research and time spent on learning new technologies and tools outside of just the database engine while also being deeply engaged with multiple departments including development teams, query performance engineering, product management, infrastructure SREs, etc.

Role And Responsibilities

Provide product support to our on-premise and cloud hosted enterprise customers, acting as the first-line-of-defense for complex technical issues, bug diagnosis, or resolving critical outages.
Identify and reproduce product issues and submit formal bug reports or feature requests to the appropriate Engineering team.
Understand and help to improve complex SQL behavior to diagnose bugs or improve performance.
Collaborate with software developers, sales engineers, and technical account managers to keep all teams up to date with current issues a customer may be facing.
Work to streamline and improve various Support and Engineering processes and tools, author new knowledge base articles and run-books, and help the team continually improve efficiency and effectiveness.
Participate in our on-call rotation that may include weekends and holidays.

Required Skills And Experience

4+ years of previous customer-facing advanced technical support experience.
Previous experience as a DBA or Support Engineer at a database company.
Experience with SQL databases and advanced SQL query optimization and tuning. You should be familiar enough with at least one commercial or open source database to decipher its EXPLAIN plan and understand potential performance impact or ways to improve the query.
Strong background in general product troubleshooting, keeping in mind that query processing issues can be impacted by database or linux configuration and resource availability.
A solid linux performance background. That means you are hands-on with Linux and your skills include generating and reading flame graphs, checking system resource utilization, and parsing verbose log files. Bonus points for familiarity with Kubernetes.
Experience with a scripting or coding language. Whether it’s C++, Python, Go, or Bash, you should have a go-to solution for quick problem-solving and be able to navigate through our extensive code base.
Familiarity with distributed systems and AWS/GCP. You understand how organizations deploy and maintain distributed applications and services across multiple machines and know how to analyze these systems for performance bottlenecks.
Experience improving support processes regarding ticket triage, escalation, and reporting business metrics back to the organization.
Strong written and verbal English communication skills. Have the ability to explain technical concepts to a wide range of end-users.

SingleStore is one platform for all data, built so you can engage with insight in every moment. Trusted by industry leaders, SingleStore enables enterprises to adapt to change as it happens, embrace diverse data with ease, and accelerate the pace of innovation. SingleStore is venture-backed and headquartered in San Francisco with offices in Portland, Seattle, Boston, Bangalore, London, Lisbon, and Kyiv. Defining the future starts with The Database of Now™.

Consistent with our commitment to diversity & inclusion, we value individuals with the ability to work on diverse teams and with a diverse range of people.

To all recruitment agencies: SingleStore does not accept agency resumes. Please do not forward resumes to SingleStore employees. SingleStore is not responsible for any fees related to unsolicited resumes and will not pay fees to any third-party agency or company that does not have a signed agreement with the Company.

To achieve that we are building a new community around Python opscode for open source applications, running on Kubernetes. We want to move all of Canonical and Ubuntu IS onto this new, open source codebase.

We are confident that we can dramatically improve the experience of running complex business operations - and then we can help our customers embrace those new techniques and products.

Shape high quality open source monitoring and alerting infrastructure
Simplify open source operations for our customers and open source community

Designed and built automated candidate scheduling. This feature automates scheduling by calculating possible times from a pool of interviewers and presenting these times to the candidate for selection via our responsive web app.
Built a generalized filter architecture that allows users to create complex filters for any record with a consistent UI and compile it to SQL in our backend. Many user-facing features use it.
Spec-ed, designed, and implemented a feature that allows users to complete the process of signing offers entirely within Ashby. This project involved talking to customers to understand their requirements, deciding what technologies to use, building a prototype, and working with other team members to integrate the final implementation into additional features.

These projects reflect what we’re accomplishing at Ashby: improving the productivity of working professionals (starting with talent teams) with intelligent and powerful software. We put a lot of effort into designing products that are approachable to beginners but mastered & extended by power users. In many ways, spreadsheets set the bar here.

We have many customers, great revenue growth, years of runway, and amazing investors like YCombinator, Elad Gil, and Lachy Groom. I’ll share more once we meet.

One formality, we do require at least 8 years of experience as a full-time software engineer for this role.

Engineering Culture

Our engineering culture is motivated by Benji’s (my co-founder and CEO) and my belief that a small talented team, given the right environment, can build high-quality software fast (and work regular hours!).

Collaboration is Natural & Communication is Deliberate

Our engineering team (and the team at large) consists of lifelong learners who are humble and kind (meet them here!). These attributes create an environment where collaboration happens naturally (we filter for it in interviews). We combine this with research, prototyping, and written proposals to see around corners and get feedback from the team across time zones. Focus time is something that we hold sacred, and, with thoughtful and deliberate communication, engineers can focus 36h out of a 40h work week (I wrote about it here).

Increase Leverage, not Team Size

We built Ashby with the quality, breadth, and depth that many customers would expect from much larger teams over larger time scales. We’ve done this through investment in:
Great developer tooling. Our CI/CD takes ~10m, and we deploy at least 10x a day. Everyone on the team has contributed to developer experience 💪🏾
Building blocks to create powerful and customizable products fast. At the core of Ashby is a set of common components (analytics modeling and query language, policy engine, workflow engine, design system) which we are constantly improving. Each improvement to a common component cascades throughout our app (short video below).

Here’s an impromptu quote from Arjun in our company Slack of what it’s like to build a feature at Ashby:

And a demo of one of these building blocks:

Give Engineers Ownership & Autonomy

We, as engineers, find clever ways to solve problems, which amplifies when we deeply understand the problem. Benji and I did our best work as engineers when we had a deep understanding of the end-user and the business and ownership over the solution. Our engineering culture reflects this experience: engineers own projects end-to-end, from speaking with users to writing product specs to UX design. These are skills that we often don’t get to practice as engineers, and, at Ashby, we provide mentorship to grow them and help from the team where you want it.

Put Effort into Diversity

Diverse teams drive innovation and better outcomes. Having seen my mother and partner build their careers as minority women in non-diverse fields, I want to make sure Ashby creates opportunities for the next generation of engineers from underrepresented groups.

Today, 26% of engineers at Ashby are from underrepresented groups. It’s not great, and we are taking conscious steps to improve, like sourcing diverse candidates, providing generous paid family leave, no leetcode interviews, and more.

Interview Process

At Ashby, our team and interview process want to help you show your best self. We’ll dive into past projects and simulate working together via pair programming, writing tech specs collaboratively, and talking through decisions (no leetcode or whiteboard exercises). Our interview process is three rounds:
30-minute introduction call (we demo Ashby!)
A technical screen (take home or 75-minute in-person)
A virtual on-site of 3 hours and 30 minutes (can be split across two days)

Your hiring manager will be your main point of contact and prep you for interviews. You’ll meet my co-founder and CEO plus 4 to 6 people in engineering (with 15 minutes in each interview to ask them questions). If we don’t give an offer, we’ll provide feedback!

Your First Two Months at Ashby

We want an exceptional onboarding experience for every new hire. At Ashby, your dev environment sets up with a single script, you push your first change on day one, and we spend the rest of the time building your confidence in our codebase and practices culminating in the delivery of a prominent, impactful feature. We’ll pair you with a peer who’ll guide you through your first tasks and be someone you rely on, from answering questions to pair programming.

Technology Stack

I’m sharing our tech stack with the caveat that we don’t require previous experience in it (but a love of typed languages is helpful 😀): TypeScript (frontend & backend), Node.js, React, Apollo GraphQL, Postgres, Redis.

Benefits
Competitive salary and equity.
10-year exercise window for stock options. You shouldn’t feel pressure to purchase stock options if you leave Ashby —do it when you feel financially comfortable.
Unlimited PTO with four weeks recommended per year. Expect “Vacation?” in our one-on-one agenda until you start taking it 😅.
Twelve weeks of fully paid family leave in the US. We plan to expand this to employees in other countries as situations arise.
Generous equipment, software, and office furniture budget. Get what you need to be happy and productive!
$100/month education budget with more expensive items (like conferences) covered with manager approval.
If you’re in the US, top-notch health insurance for you and your dependents with all premiums covered by us.

Ashby’s success hinges on hiring great people and creating an environment where we can be happy, feel challenged, and do our best work. We’re being deliberate about building that environment from the ground up. I hope that excites you enough to apply.

Ashby provides equal employment opportunities (EEO) to all employees and applicants for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, genetics, sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression. We are committed to a diverse and inclusive workforce and welcome people from all backgrounds, experiences, perspectives, and abilities.

Why will you enjoy this new opportunity?

We provide and operate hundreds of managed databases instances for critical teams in VMware and a growing number of other customers. Most of those database servers are PostgreSQL which is not surprising since it is the most popular database in the World. Over time, we will encounter every possible performance, scalability, and reliability challenge that a PostgreSQL operator may face.

As a Database Engineer or administrator, you will design how to solve those challenges. That will help you grow to be a world-class expert on PostgreSQL and similar relational databases.

Success in the Role: What are the performance outcomes over the first 6-12 months you will work toward completing?

In 12 months, you will apply your existing experience in operating PostgreSQL to define how we configure and deploy the database, including:

Deployment topology and replication configuration for high availability. Selection and configuration for off-site, incremental and schedules backups. Adapting the configuration of PostgreSQL to different types of workloads.

In all cases, you will work with the rest of the team to automate the application of those designs and monitor how they impact the performance of customer databases.

What type of work will I be doing? What assignments will I be performing on a regular basis?

Typical assignments for your position will be:

Research how to configure and deploy PostgreSQL, and in the future other databases, to achieve the outcomes above.
Automate in your tool of choice – Terraform, Ansible, Kubernetes Controllers (Golang) – applying that configuration.
Define metrics for each outcome and test configuration changes at scale. Troubleshoot database issues that occur in our test environment or in the deployments of our customers.
Adapt your design accordingly.

Who is the hiring manager? What is the structure of the team/organization I will be working with?

You’ll be joining a growing team of engineers located in Bulgaria, Ireland, India and the US. The larger team is split into several sub-teams with local management, focused on the different areas of the platform.

We are looking for individuals who are self-driven and have the passion to learn new skills and solve complex technical issues. The leadership for this role believes in creating a pleasant and inclusive workplace and building strong relationships and collaboration within the team.

Where is this role located?

The location of this role is flexible within Bulgaria. Work will be done from an office some days during the week and other days from a non-VMware building with the employees having the option to choose the option of working fully remote.

Bloomreach is the world’s #1 Commerce Experience Cloud, empowering brands to deliver customer journeys so personalized, they feel like magic. It offers a suite of products that drive true personalization and digital commerce growth, including:
Discovery, offering AI-driven search and merchandising
Content, offering a headless CMS

Bloomreach recently raised $175 million in a Series F funding round, bringing its total valuation to $2.2 billion. The investment was led by Goldman Sachs Asset Management with participation from Bain Capital Ventures and Sixth Street Growth. For more information, visit Bloomreach.com.

We are currently expanding our Application Platform team and we are looking for Backend Software Engineer. Is ""security"", ""curiosity"" or ""growth"" your middle name? Then you are a good fit and you can be one of us. You can work remotely or from one of our local offices. The salary starts at €3,000 based on your experience level.

About your role and the team:

The Application Platform team empowers other engineering teams to build their services effectively and with security and compliance built-in by designing, implementing, and maintaining the magic solid foundations and the core frameworks of the Bloomreach Engagement.

Examples of the initiatives driven by this team are:
Integrated zero-trust authentication and authorization management system.
Platform for collecting and processing audit logs in a distributed environment.
Notification center, which allows other teams to communicate information to customers through a single unified channel (upcoming project).

What you might like about this role:
Wide reach - we deal with teams across the company - product, security, architects, engineers, even customers.
Security perspective will be a key element of your day-to-day work
Developing Cloud Native services consumed by customers as well as other engineering teams

What your typical day might look like:

You start your day with a code review of your colleague’s tasks while sipping a cup of fresh-brewed tea or coffee, looking for any signs of problems and possible optimizations. Then you join your teammates on a quick daily standup, where you discuss what you’re currently working on and the plan for the next few days.

After the meeting, you get into “the zone” and spend a few undisturbed hours working on the new authentication framework while making sure it’s safely covered by a suite of unit tests. With a few clicks you quickly spin up a brand new instance of the system in the development cluster, deploy your change and notify the frontend engineer that it’s ready.

You grab a snack and take a little break from coding. Instead, you help a fellow backend engineer from another team figure out the best way to integrate their new service with the audit logging platform. In the meantime the frontend engineer gets back to you and confirms that all the new endpoints work as expected, so you create a merge request and ask your teammates for a code review. It’s a complex piece of code, so you go through it together.

After your code is approved, you merge it, automatically deploying it to the staging environment where it receives further testing by the QA team and automated integration tests before being released to production.

You end your day in a short meeting with a product manager and the director of engineering, where you flesh out the idea you had over lunch yesterday for a new approach to release management that would make the whole process even faster.

Our tech stack:
Python & Go
MongoDB, Redis, Apache Kafka
Kubernetes (GKE)
Various Google Cloud Platform services (Pub/Sub, BigTable, DataFlow, ...)
Gitlab CI/CD, Prometheus and Grafana

What we expect of the candidate:

The ideal candidate has:
At least 3 year experience developing in Python or Golang
Designing and implementing production-grade REST APIs
Having experience with operating services in production is beneficial
A working understanding of fundamental web security principles (OWASP), Authentication and Authorization practices
Experience with database systems of different kinds (MongoDB, Redis, Apache Kafka)

Regional benefits:
Monthly lunch entitlement by up to 110€ per month
Pension scheme or Health insurance depending on region

Bloomreach is the world’s #1 Commerce Experience Cloud, empowering brands to deliver customer journeys so personalized, they feel like magic. It offers a suite of products that drive true personalization and digital commerce growth, including:
Discovery, offering AI-driven search and merchandising
Content, offering a headless CMS

Bloomreach serves over 850 global brands including Albertsons, Bosch, Puma, FC Bayern München, and Marks & Spencer. Bloomreach recently raised $175 million in a Series F funding round, bringing its total valuation to $2.2 billion. The investment was led by Goldman Sachs Asset Management with participation from Bain Capital Ventures and Sixth Street Growth. For more information, visit Bloomreach.com.

We are currently expanding our Application Platform team and we are looking for Backend Software Engineer. Is ""security"", ""curiosity"" or ""growth"" your middle name? Then you are a good fit and you can be one of us. You can work remotely or from one of our local offices. The salary starts at €3,000 based on your experience level.

About your role and the team:

The Application Platform team empowers other engineering teams to build their services effectively and with security and compliance built-in by designing, implementing, and maintaining the magic solid foundations and the core frameworks of the Bloomreach Engagement.

Examples of the initiatives driven by this team are:
Integrated zero-trust authentication and authorization management system.
Platform for collecting and processing audit logs in a distributed environment.
Notification center, which allows other teams to communicate information to customers through a single unified channel (upcoming project).

What you might like about this role:
Wide reach - we deal with teams across the company - product, security, architects, engineers, even customers.
Security perspective will be a key element of your day-to-day work
Developing Cloud Native services consumed by customers as well as other engineering teams

What your typical day might look like:

You start your day with a code review of your colleague’s tasks while sipping a cup of fresh-brewed tea or coffee, looking for any signs of problems and possible optimizations. Then you join your teammates on a quick daily standup, where you discuss what you’re currently working on and the plan for the next few days.

After the meeting, you get into “the zone” and spend a few undisturbed hours working on the new authentication framework while making sure it’s safely covered by a suite of unit tests. With a few clicks you quickly spin up a brand new instance of the system in the development cluster, deploy your change and notify the frontend engineer that it’s ready.

You grab a snack and take a little break from coding. Instead, you help a fellow backend engineer from another team figure out the best way to integrate their new service with the audit logging platform. In the meantime the frontend engineer gets back to you and confirms that all the new endpoints work as expected, so you create a merge request and ask your teammates for a code review. It’s a complex piece of code, so you go through it together.

After your code is approved, you merge it, automatically deploying it to the staging environment where it receives further testing by the QA team and automated integration tests before being released to production.

You end your day in a short meeting with a product manager and the director of engineering, where you flesh out the idea you had over lunch yesterday for a new approach to release management that would make the whole process even faster.

Our tech stack:
Python & Go
MongoDB, Redis, Apache Kafka
Kubernetes (GKE)
Various Google Cloud Platform services (Pub/Sub, BigTable, DataFlow, ...)
Gitlab CI/CD, Prometheus and Grafana

What we expect of the candidate:

The ideal candidate has:
At least 3 year experience developing in Python or Golang
Designing and implementing production-grade REST APIs
Having experience with operating services in production is beneficial
A working understanding of fundamental web security principles (OWASP), Authentication and Authorization practices
Experience with database systems of different kinds (MongoDB, Redis, Apache Kafka)

Regional benefits:
Monthly lunch entitlement by up to 110€ per month
Pension scheme or Health insurance depending on region

The Elevator Pitch: Why will you enjoy this new opportunity?

You share a passion for crafting software that has a significant impact for the world and future of cloud computing. You love solving problems and learning new things and are looking for a company that helps enable those ideas. Technologies come and go, but that excites you because of the endless possibilities it creates. You are looking for an opportunity to work for a company whose software is utilized by every Fortune 500 company and significantly impacts every industry. You want to be a part of a collaborative environment whose teams care about the product they are creating, how they create it, and the impact it has on customers’ business objectives.

VMware Carbon Black has established itself as a leader in the endpoint security space. The product portfolio includes the rapidly growing Carbon Black Cloud (CBC) platform that delivers next-generation endpoint protection capabilities from the cloud. We live and breathe distributed systems, leveraging highly scalable and robust microservice architectures and polyglot technology stacks on the backend and a coherent, extensible and scalable GUI platform on the frontend.

We need an engineer who can collaborate with existing engineering teams to develop, and deliver software and microservices to facilitate the CBC Data Forwarder platform, used to egress – in real time – huge data volumes to VMware Carbon Black’s customers.

Success in the Role: What are the performance goals over the first 6-12 months you will work toward completing?

Within your first 6 months

You will get to know the codebase of the Data Forwarder’s APIs and micro-services.
You will participate in the implementation of the Data Forwarder’s next generation service APIs and related infrastructure together with the existing members of the Data Forwarder team.
You will learn how to support the Data Forwarder portfolio in production and participate in the on-call service rotation.

After 6 months+

You will be an active participant in implementing Data Forwarder’s next generation service APIs and related infrastructure, with minimal assistance.
You will be encouraged to identify and suggest process improvements in coding practices, development and deployment.
You will be regularly evaluated on the code you write to ensure continued advancement of your technical skills in an environment that looks to expand them.

What type of work will you be doing? What assignments, requirements, or skills will you be performing on a regular basis?

As a new member of the Data Forwarder Team, you will:

Participate in all team scrum ceremonies
Develop and maintain software that delivers on the team’s objectives primarily in Go and, infrequently, in Python or Java
Deploy microservices to Kubernetes using Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) systems
Participate in our on-call rotation, providing operational support to our platform

What is the leadership like for this role? What is the structure and culture of the team like?

This position will report to a seasoned R&D Manager in Sofia, Bulgaria, with a strong technical background in the backend services’ space and brings many years of experience in developing software and managing high performance teams. The broader Sofia team, as well as the Data Forwarder team in US consist of highly competent engineers on all levels, focusing on iterative development, both of software and our software development practices.

You will join an established broader backend team, while pioneering the Data Forwarder team in Bulgaria. In this you will work with team members locally on-site in Sofia, as well as the Data Forwarder team counterparts in San Francisco, USA. Both teams promote open culture of work and encourage sharing ideas, learning from each other, and collaborating in different levels. This is a great opportunity for someone who likes to start new things and put their mark on a team and company.

Where is this role located?

This role is based out of VMware’s Sofia, Bulgaria office and open to candidates in the surrounding area.

Why will you enjoy this new opportunity?

We provide and operate hundreds of managed databases instances for critical teams in VMware and a growing number of other customers. Most of those database servers are PostgreSQL which is not surprising since it is the most popular database in the World. Over time, we will encounter every possible performance, scalability, and reliability challenge that a PostgreSQL operator may face.

As a Database Engineer or administrator, you will design how to solve those challenges. That will help you grow to be a world-class expert on PostgreSQL and similar relational databases.

Success in the Role: What are the performance outcomes over the first 6-12 months you will work toward completing?

Deployment topology and replication configuration for high availability. Selection and configuration for off-site, incremental and schedules backups. Adapting the configuration of PostgreSQL to different types of workloads.

In all cases, you will work with the rest of the team to automate the application of those designs and monitor how they impact the performance of customer databases.

What type of work will I be doing? What assignments will I be performing on a regular basis?

Typical assignments for your position will be:

Research how to configure and deploy PostgreSQL, and in the future other databases, to achieve the outcomes above.
Automate in your tool of choice – Terraform, Ansible, Kubernetes Controllers (Golang) – applying that configuration.
Define metrics for each outcome and test configuration changes at scale. Troubleshoot database issues that occur in our test environment or in the deployments of our customers.
Adapt your design accordingly.

Who is the hiring manager? What is the structure of the team/organization I will be working with?

You’ll be joining a growing team of engineers located in Bulgaria, Ireland, India and the US. The larger team is split into several sub-teams with local management, focused on the different areas of the platform.

We are looking for individuals who are self-driven and have the passion to learn new skills and solve complex technical issues. The leadership for this role believes in creating a pleasant and inclusive workplace and building strong relationships and collaboration within the team.

Where is this role located?

Smartcat is a fully remote startup company. We are creating an operating system for the global translation industry. Our team believes that the world becomes ever-more connected and interdependent. The borders that prevent people from trading, working together, and exchanging knowledge and innovations erode over time. That is the future we want to live in. Our mission is to speed up the pace at which that happens, building the best platform for Connected Translation. We don't believe automation will render language professionals obsolete. Instead, we place powerful software into the hands of the millions of people working to globalize their own industries, plug them into our global supply network, and enable continuous delivery of multilingual content. With tens of thousands of customers and hundreds of thousands of freelancers translating together on Smartcat, we are well on our way.

Why joining Smartcat might be your best move so far
The ongoing rise of the content economy is causing a massive shift in the language industry. All today's megatrends AI in the language space, gateway marketplaces in B2B, etc. — are converging at lightning speed. Smartcat's disruptive business model taps into this $50B industry with a platform where buyers and suppliers connect, collaborate, and leverage our workflow SaaS.
You will enjoy building with us. You will drive changes in how an old-fashioned global language industry operates while improving how hundreds of thousands of people work and millions of people exchange knowledge and ideas worldwide.
While the language industry is big and fragmented enough to keep us busy building a billion-dollar company in the next few years, we are already seeing how the platform naturally expands to adjacent language and content-related verticals, expanding our TAM and making our journey even more exciting.
We are a global team of 150+ enthusiastic people. We have been fully remote since 2020, with some locations populated with more ""Smartcatters"" than others, such as Boston, NYC, SF, the Bay Area, London, Lisbon, and Yerevan. We strive to grow aggressively, but we also preserve our high performance, engagement, and open feedback culture. As diverse as we are, we love working and having fun together, and we're sure you'll love working with us too.
Smartcat is backed by Matrix Partners, FJ Labs, and other top VC firms focusing on SaaS and marketplace startups (you might recognize names like HubSpot, Zendesk, Uber, Stripe, RigUp, and Quora in their portfolios). This helps us innovate at a fast pace and learn from top professionals in other industries.
We are looking for someone who will become a part of the team and play a critical role in the most exciting part of our journey from a post-Series B startup to a company exceeding $1b in GMV and valuation. Our journey isn't for the faint of heart. You need to be an extremely fast learner to bring value to our users and the industry as a whole. You need to see the big picture and execute strategies that significantly increase shareholder value over time. We need a sharp mind who can stay two steps ahead on the road. We've got lots of success to share if you're ready for it."

We strive to give our employees everything they need to make meaningful contributions to the overall success of our company. We’re looking for go-getters that are excited to thrive in a company going through an exciting growth phase!

We are a fast-growing SaaS company based in the United States. We are changing the way the world buys enterprise software. We do this by providing intelligent demo automation software that helps you scale Presales. How does this work?

We believe buying enterprise software should be simple, pleasant, and fast instead of complex, painful, and slow (which is how it is today). Buyers now want instant access to presales (sales engineering) resources throughout the buying experience but they find it harder and harder to get what they need. Using Consensus, a sales engineering team builds a library of reusable interactive video demos that Sales sends out on-demand. Consensus automatically personalizes the experience and tracks engagement as the prospect shares the demo with other stakeholders in the buying group, bringing the entire buying group to live demos better educated and ready to talk specifics.

This not only reduces unqualified demos to near zero and can double the presales team’s productivity, it also removes the ""demo lag time"" for prospects and shortens the sales cycle by as much as 68%.

Our Values:

Our values are extremely important to us and we hope that they mean something to you too. We want everyone to bring their authentic selves to work every day. We hope you can help us continue to grow without having to be perfect, but willing to put your name on something knowing it is a “version one”. Everyone here takes total ownership and accountability, because owning our outcomes means making a real contribution. We also believe in a “no peacemongering” principle. We know our path to success is hard and we don’t hesitate to ask hard things of others. We are respectfully confrontational to one another and ask direct accountability questions.

Description

Who We Are

Firebolt is a disruptor in the data & analytics space. Based on technology that delivers an order-of-magnitude performance leap in TB-scale analytics, Firebolt helps the most data-forward companies create a new wave of data & analytics experiences for end-users. With a team of world-class data experts, led by leadership veterans from Looker, Google BigQuery, Imply and Sisense, and backed by $264M in funding - we are growing quickly and are poised to build the data platform of the future, and set a new bar for what can be done with data.

The Team

At the heart of any modern SQL database lies the query compiler. The query compiler takes the user-provided SQL query, parses it, and then transforms it into a representation the database runtime can understand. Along this path, a variety of optimizations such as predicate placement and join reordering are performed.

Firebolt’s planner team owns this core component of our cloud-based data warehouse. The team is responsible for making sure our SQL dialect is loved by our customers, and that we are able to transform our customer’s queries into fast execution plans for our multi-threaded, distributed runtime.

The Role

As a senior compiler engineer in our planner team, you help shape the direction of our SQL planner. You work on new optimization rules, SQL features, and contribute to the performance and robustness of our state-of-the-art planner.

You will work closely with other database teams at Firebolt, such as storage and query execution, to seek out and drive novel optimization opportunities for our planner. Examples include further optimizing our distributed query plans, or integrating additional metadata into the planner.

Requirements

Must Have
Bachelor’s/Master’s/PhD in Computer Science, Engineering, or a related field, or equivalent experience
Fluency in a modern programming language, all our database teams work with C++20
3+ years of experience with compilers or optimization, either as a researcher or in industry

Nice to Have
Previous experience with SQL compilers and query optimization
Previous experience with distributed data processing systems
Background in modern, high-performance C++"

What is Amplemarket all about?

Amplemarket's premise is that a lot of the playbooks used by B2B sales teams that worked 5 years ago don't cut it anymore.

In today's environment, sales teams need to have a tremendous amount of information about their prospects to decide when is the best moment and channel to reach out in the most relevant way. You can't do this with 5 different data/sales enablement point solutions that don't share the same data schema and barely communicate with each other. Amplemarket is the all-in-one compound solution that enables this.

Our AI-powered sales platform helps B2B companies generate more opportunities thanks to our advanced lead generation engine, hyper-personalized sequencing, omnichannel outreach, and AI-powered smart actions. We are backed by Y Combinator, and we are powering the sales teams at some of the fastest-growing companies in the world like Deel, Moveworks, H1 and Vanta.

Software engineers build the core of Amplemarket.

The three co-founders have an engineering background (João, Luís and Mica studied Physics & Computer Science at university) and deeply value the work that engineers are responsible for.

Our main goal is to build a sales platform that helps companies grow. Our product requires us to solve a myriad of difficult engineering problems very diverse in nature: from working on NLP models that can extract information from a thread of emails to scaling an elasticsearch cluster holding terabytes of data.

We are deeply aware of the importance of our tool to our customers and look for people that share that vision.

Among other things, our stack includes:

Ruby on Rails, React, PostgresQL, Elasticsearch, Redis

We don't require you to have experience in our stack to apply.

Our customers use Amplemarket on a daily basis. We keep and enrich valuable data that is critical for sales reps's success. We empower our users to engage with their prospects in the most personalized way. Luckily, you are reading this, and when you join Amplemarket will have even more jaw-dropping features.

As an early member of engineering team, you will build new user experiences and product features that are critical to our customers. You will work cross functionally in a fullstack team and in close collaboration with product, design, customer success, support, and sales functions.

You will:
Work directly with the co-founders
Have lots of autonomy and impact
Ship new features every week
Own central, complex components of the application
Implement a scalable, stable, and user-friendly product that can handle our current growth
Collaborate with experienced software engineers in the design, development and maintenance stages of the product
Drive and deliver on our product roadmap, turning rough specs into features
Find elegant solutions to usability problems

About you:
You have experience designing and maintaining complex/large/growing systems
When reviewing new system designs or code, you naturally think about what can go wrong: edge cases, failure modes, bottlenecks, migrations, releases, interesting metrics, etc
You love debugging and finding the root cause of production issues
You are proactive, when you see something broken you jump on it to fix it or suggest improvements
You strive to use best practices and always test the software that you deliver
You are based somewhere between the GMT-3 and GMT+2 timezones

Some more about Amplemarket:
We are a post-Series A start-up
Backed by YCombinator
Strong technical founding team from MIT and IST (also founders of https://fermatslibrary.com/)
Fast growing startup with product market fit
Great team spirit

We offer:
Nice work environment
Competitive Salary
Health Insurance
Stock Options
Annual Company Trip in a secret location
and more!

Regardless of race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, age, disability, or if you're parenting the next generation of innovators, we firmly believe that what truly matters is how your skills, knowledge and personality fit our company.

👪 Team and environment

We are looking for an Application Security Engineer to join Romain in the technical security team. Reporting directly to Guillaume, our Head of Information Security, you will be responsible for all technical matters involving security issues. Working with the security compliance team, you may be required to provide technical support to the team in the definition and monitoring of long-term projects designed to strengthen the security of our assets in a sustainable manner. You will have a key role in advising, assisting, informing, training and alerting all employees (especially developers). You will also be responsible for the day-to-day management of technical operations in the context of ISO 27001 certification.

The technical security team is involved from the identification/detection of a security issue to its resolution (development and implementation of the security patches). If the needs or the complexity of the patch are too great, the security team can count on the support of the developers and in particular the Security Champions team to sustain the effort.

🎯 Your tasks

You Will Be Required To Work On

All technical security issues/projects while providing technical support on compliance needs

Let’s Break It Down
Security by design within the projects by discussing with the teams to consider the security risks
To be proactive in the security projects to be carried out, to define and to prioritize them
Ensure the security of the main Web application in Ruby on Rails and React: its dependencies, its code, its infrastructure and its configuration
Security and maintaining the security condition of other applications and AWS infrastructure, including its Kubernetes environment (AWS EKS)
Conduct and perform regular security assessments (internally or by an external firm) on the applications (code reviews/pentests/bug bounty in particular) and the infrastructure
Conducting code reviews from a secure development point of view (about 80 releases per day, not all of which have security implications, but it is an important and recurring topic)
Build/Improve secure development training materials and conduct regular training sessions with the developers
Contribute to tenders to explain our security policies and provide the necessary technical details
Learn about Rails and React to detect vulnerabilities during code reviews and implement associated patches
Strengthen the current means of detecting malicious attempts
These missions are not exhaustive and remain evolving.
🥇You’re the right candidate if
You have just graduated or ideally have a first experience in defensive or offensive application security, are a quick learner and like to work on different projects. As a security team member at Pennylane, you’ll work on all security topics (application, cloud infrastructure, security by design, training, ISO 27001, etc.).
Working in an English-speaking environment doesn't scare you, you don't need to be bilingual. You need to be able to share your ideas and thoughts well in spoken and written English and to understand what is being said. If you need help with this, we can provide you with a Busuu subscription to improve your English immediately.
You ideally have the following skills/experience:
Able to perform offensive security assessments on an infrastructure or an application
You know how to exploit and fix a wide range of Web vulnerabilities (not just the OWASP top 10)
You already have experience in a programming language (Ruby, Python, JavaScript), either for quick and dirty scripting to exploit a vulnerability or for larger projects
You have experience in cloud infrastructure security
You are able to popularize technical terms to facilitate the adoption of security measures within projects or to broadcast messages to Pennylaners
You are autonomous, proactive and organized
Working with remote colleagues is not an issue for you
Bonus: if you have already developed in Ruby or React and/or if you have technical application security certifications.

A multi-skilled profile will be preferred.

✨ Our vision
We aim to become the most beloved financial Operating System of European SMEs.
We help business owners get rid of the time consuming hassle of handling accounting and finance, while giving them access to key information that they can use to make better decisions.
Meanwhile, we’re helping accountants. By using Pennylane, rather than doing manual and repetitive tasks, they can spend more time advising and guiding their clients.

The Role

We are looking for highly talented and driven senior front-end software engineers who take pride in their work, to expand our Engineering team in Portugal.

What You’ll Do

Design solutions: Define the best technical solutions to business problems, contributing to an architectural vision that will scale up to be the world's leading research platform.

You probably have a degree in a STEM subject, but we’re happy to work with people who perfected their craft via a different route.
Experience working at a similar level in a mature Engineering team, and looking to take your career to the next level. We’re looking for people who have incredible potential.
Technical expertise with at least one Frontend framework, ideally React.
Proven track record – You’ve made a demonstrable impact in your previous roles, standing out from your peers.
Highly driven and proactive – you relentlessly and independently push through hurdles and drive towards excellent outcomes.
Meticulous – you hold high standards and have an obsessive attention to detail.

Our mission is to reinvent the way companies manage their open source information systems - on public clouds and in their own data centres. To achieve that we are building a new community around Python opscode for open source applications, running on Kubernetes. We want to move all of Canonical and Ubuntu IS onto this new, open source codebase.

We are confident that we can dramatically improve the experience of running complex business operations - and then we can help our customers embrace those new techniques and products. Traditionally, IS is an inward-facing operation. We would like to transform our IS team into an extension of the product engineering capability at Canonical. Our internal workloads are in many cases the same open source workloads that our customers want to operate. This team will productise those workloads for real-time automated operations on Kubernetes.

This role is ideal for software engineers who enjoy Python, have a passion for distributed systems, and an interest in the entire Linux stack - from kernel to networking to virtualization and containers. It is a role that requires rigour in both code and customer interactions. Our engineers are technically astute open source enthusiasts who are excited about cloud computing and are ready to join a global team charged with delivering world class services to our customers.

Strong Python development skills and familiarity with Kubernetes are key requirements of this role. You'll work closely with other teams in Canonical to ensure your products operate reliably, efficiently and scale to production sized workloads for our customers looking to adopt cutting-edge technology. You will participate and be responsible for ensuring sound software architecture and follow best practices in software quality, testing and documentation.

What you'll do
Work in Python to design and deliver open source software operations code
Work across the entire Linux stack, from kernel, networking, storage, to applications
Learn to think rigorously about application and infrastructure reliability
Shape high quality open source monitoring and alerting infrastructure
Simplify open source operations for our customers and open source community
Demonstrate sound engineering design and testing principles in your code
Follow agile software development practices
Coach and develop your colleagues where you have insights
Grow a healthy, collaborative engineering culture in line with company values
Work from home with global travel once or twice a year for up to 2 weeks for events

Who you are
You love technology and working with brilliant people
You have a Bachelor's or equivalent in Computer Science, STEM or similar degree
You are experienced with Linux systems administration, package management, and operations
You have hands-on experience with at least one public cloud
You are familiar with Docker and Kubernetes
You are an excellent Python programmer and enjoy challenging projects
You understand the importance of reliable software and strive to design and code to that expectation
You are organized and want your team to deliver timely, high quality software

About Canonical

Canonical is a growing international software company that works with the open-source community to deliver Ubuntu, ""the world's best free software platform"".

Implement and utilize configuration management and deployment tools
Monitor systems, services and service clusters, optimize performance and resource utilization
Participate in incident response, diagnosis and follow-up on system outages or alerts across Wikimedia's production infrastructure

Skills and Experience:
2+ years experience in a DBA role as part of a team

Knowledge and experience of (Free and Open Source) RDBMS (preferably MariaDB or MySQL) administration (understanding of and experience with replication is essential) and support, debugging query performance and schema design
Comfortable with shell and at least one of the scripting languages used in an SRE/Operations engineering context (Python, Go, Bash, Ruby, etc.)
Passion for automating tasks and processes
Strong English language skills and ability to work independently, as an effective part of a globally distributed team

Additionally, we'd love it if you have:

You have a Bachelor's or equivalent in Computer Science, STEM or similar degree
You are experienced with Linux systems administration, package management, and operations
You have hands-on experience with at least one public cloud
You are familiar with Docker and Kubernetes
You are an excellent Python programmer and enjoy challenging projects
You understand the importance of reliable software and strive to design and code to that expectation
You are organized and want your team to deliver timely, high quality software

About Canonical

With tens of millions of active users and hundreds of thousands of daily downloads, we’re one of Europe’s leading app developers. We’re looking for a talented, and passionate native Android developer eager to help us make the best apps on the Play Store and contribute to improving our technology stack.

A few examples of your responsibilities
Write quality code that’s testable and maintainable. You understand the benefits of code that’s clean and idiomatic.
Follow best practices in terms of coding style, Git usage, commit messages, pull requests, and team conventions.
Perform code reviews and play an active part in tech discussions.
Work on apps, libraries, or tooling, depending on your skills and preferences.
Make proposals to improve our tech stack, libraries, and tooling.
Contribute to the product development of the apps you’ll work on. We’re all about taking a proactive role and ownership of your work.
Help define the software architecture of entire apps or new features—and then develop them. The work spans a broad range, from engineering and coding features to polishing world-class user interfaces.
Constantly improve the quality of our products by fixing bugs and refactoring the code base where necessary, as well as adding that wow factor to put smiles on our users’ faces.
Stay up-to-speed with new technologies (particularly on Android), and test the promising ones to make sure we don’t miss out on game-changing opportunities.

What we look for
Passion. You love what you do, and your enthusiasm never wavers with the specifics of a given task or team. Whether you’re on a plane, train, or sofa, odds are that you’ll be found with your nose in a book or article on the subject.
Reasoning and depth of learning. You’re structured and creative enough to solve most challenging problems independently, given the necessary knowledge. You learn new concepts and skills rapidly, and love to nerd out and go in-depth.
Accuracy and precision. Your attention to detail is spot-on, and you’re painstakingly accurate.
Logical-analytical abilities. You’re a quick learner who’s able to investigate and effectively pick up new concepts on your own. You can solve unforeseen challenges with creativity and structure, and can do so independently.
Drive. You’re energetic and hard-working, and you persevere through adversity until the job is done—and done impeccably. You’re massively into getting results, and always aim for excellence in what you do.
Curiosity and initiative. You love exploring, and are forever hunting down new opportunities and testing fresh ideas. Rather than waiting to be told what to do, you go seek.
Humility. You’re down to earth, eager to listen to feedback and constructive criticism, and ready to support your team with whatever it needs to succeed.
Proficiency in English. You read, write, and speak proficiently in English.

What we offer
Make a difference. Be the owner of your effort—from day one, you’re one of the team and fully trusted to take responsibility for your tasks. You’ll have every incentive to make a major impact.
International reach. We’re a global company, and your work will have worldwide exposure.
The finest tools. You get the best hardware on the market and all the software you could need. We can't wait to introduce you to our high-tech approach and our cutting-edge workflows.
Talented, knowledgeable colleagues. Learn from (and teach) some of the brightest and most skilled people you’ll ever meet. Your talent is going to blossom here.
Unique career opportunity. By joining a fast-growing company on a mission to become one of the world's greatest, it’s an unparalleled opportunity to turbocharge your learning and career prospects.
Continuous education. Spooners get unlimited backing for learning investments, including Italian or English lessons and things like courses, conferences, and books. There’s no permission or approval process—you’re fully trusted to use the company’s resources efficiently.
Wonderful HQ. Natural light, silent rooms, state-of-the-art hardware, fun-filled common spaces...the list never ends! You’ll certainly be in the right environment to do your best work. And, when it’s time to switch off, you can do that in style and comfort.
Remote working. Spend as much or as little time in our Milan office as you choose. Many Spooners like to change up their environment and get out of the city whenever the mood strikes. You’ve always got the freedom to decide where today’s office is.
Flexible schedule. Our regular hours are 9-6 GMT+1, but this isn’t a “clock in, clock out” company. You’re fully trusted to create the right conditions for your own personal peak productivity. We only ask that you’re available to your teammates a good chunk of the day (six hours or so). That’s why it’s generally best to be based somewhere with a similar time zone—between GMT-2 and GMT+3.
Competitive salary and stock options. Our compensation package is highly competitive, and can grow rapidly and include stock options, depending on your performance and seniority.

Commitment & contract
Fixed-term or internship.

Location
Milan, Italy or fully remote.
If you choose the on-site option, it’s fine if you prefer to work remotely sometimes. We offer substantial support for relocation, including finding an apartment in Milan and paying the rent for 12 weeks.

The selection process
If you successfully pass through our screening process, we’ll invite you to take on a few tests that assess how you approach and solve unfamiliar problems. If you’re successful there, we’ll invite you to take part in some interviews. We welcome applications in English and Italian.

Bending Spoons is an equal opportunity and affirmative action employer. We consider for employment all applicants and we provide reasonable accommodations for candidates with disabilities, which can be requested at accommodations-ext@bendingspoons.com.

Studies suggest that women tend not to apply for a job if their CV isn’t a perfect fit. Here, we look for talent and potential—not just experience and expertise. So if you like the role and think you could be awesome at it, go ahead and apply."

With tens of millions of active users and hundreds of thousands of daily downloads, we’re one of Europe’s leading app developers. We’re looking for a talented, and passionate native Android developer eager to help us make the best apps on the Play Store and contribute to improving our technology stack.

A few examples of your responsibilities
Write quality code that’s testable and maintainable. You understand the benefits of code that’s clean and idiomatic.
Follow best practices in terms of coding style, Git usage, commit messages, pull requests, and team conventions.
Perform code reviews and play an active part in tech discussions.
Work on apps, libraries, or tooling, depending on your skills and preferences.
Make proposals to improve our tech stack, libraries, and tooling.
Contribute to the product development of the apps you’ll work on. We’re all about taking a proactive role and ownership of your work.
Help define the software architecture of entire apps or new features—and then develop them. The work spans a broad range, from engineering and coding features to polishing world-class user interfaces.
Constantly improve the quality of our products by fixing bugs and refactoring the code base where necessary, as well as adding that wow factor to put smiles on our users’ faces.
Stay up-to-speed with new technologies (particularly on Android), and test the promising ones to make sure we don’t miss out on game-changing opportunities.

What we look for
Passion. You love what you do, and your enthusiasm never wavers with the specifics of a given task or team. Whether you’re on a plane, train, or sofa, odds are that you’ll be found with your nose in a book or article on the subject.
Reasoning and depth of learning. You’re structured and creative enough to solve most challenging problems independently, given the necessary knowledge. You learn new concepts and skills rapidly, and love to nerd out and go in-depth.
Accuracy and precision. Your attention to detail is spot-on, and you’re painstakingly accurate.
Logical-analytical abilities. You’re a quick learner who’s able to investigate and effectively pick up new concepts on your own. You can solve unforeseen challenges with creativity and structure, and can do so independently.
Drive. You’re energetic and hard-working, and you persevere through adversity until the job is done—and done impeccably. You’re massively into getting results, and always aim for excellence in what you do.
Curiosity and initiative. You love exploring, and are forever hunting down new opportunities and testing fresh ideas. Rather than waiting to be told what to do, you go seek.
Humility. You’re down to earth, eager to listen to feedback and constructive criticism, and ready to support your team with whatever it needs to succeed.
Proficiency in English. You read, write, and speak proficiently in English.

What we offer
Make a difference. Be the owner of your effort—from day one, you’re one of the team and fully trusted to take responsibility for your tasks. You’ll have every incentive to make a major impact.
International reach. We’re a global company, and your work will have worldwide exposure.
The finest tools. You get the best hardware on the market and all the software you could need. We can't wait to introduce you to our high-tech approach and our cutting-edge workflows.
Talented, knowledgeable colleagues. Learn from (and teach) some of the brightest and most skilled people you’ll ever meet. Your talent is going to blossom here.
Unique career opportunity. By joining a fast-growing company on a mission to become one of the world's greatest, it’s an unparalleled opportunity to turbocharge your learning and career prospects.
Continuous education. Spooners get unlimited backing for learning investments, including Italian or English lessons and things like courses, conferences, and books. There’s no permission or approval process—you’re fully trusted to use the company’s resources efficiently.
Wonderful HQ. Natural light, silent rooms, state-of-the-art hardware, fun-filled common spaces...the list never ends! You’ll certainly be in the right environment to do your best work. And, when it’s time to switch off, you can do that in style and comfort.
Remote working. Spend as much or as little time in our Milan office as you choose. Many Spooners like to change up their environment and get out of the city whenever the mood strikes. You’ve always got the freedom to decide where today’s office is.
Flexible schedule. Our regular hours are 9-6 GMT+1, but this isn’t a “clock in, clock out” company. You’re fully trusted to create the right conditions for your own personal peak productivity. We only ask that you’re available to your teammates a good chunk of the day (six hours or so). That’s why it’s generally best to be based somewhere with a similar time zone—between GMT-2 and GMT+3.
Competitive salary and stock options. Our compensation package is highly competitive, and can grow rapidly and include stock options, depending on your performance and seniority.

Commitment & contract
Fixed-term or internship.

Location
Milan, Italy or fully remote.
If you choose the on-site option, it’s fine if you prefer to work remotely sometimes. We offer substantial support for relocation, including finding an apartment in Milan and paying the rent for 12 weeks.

The selection process
If you successfully pass through our screening process, we’ll invite you to take on a few tests that assess how you approach and solve unfamiliar problems. If you’re successful there, we’ll invite you to take part in some interviews. We welcome applications in English and Italian.

Bending Spoons is an equal opportunity and affirmative action employer. We consider for employment all applicants and we provide reasonable accommodations for candidates with disabilities, which can be requested at accommodations-ext@bendingspoons.com.

Studies suggest that women tend not to apply for a job if their CV isn’t a perfect fit. Here, we look for talent and potential—not just experience and expertise. So if you like the role and think you could be awesome at it, go ahead and apply."

We are currently expanding our Application Platform team and we are looking for Backend Software Engineer. Is ""security"", ""curiosity"" or ""growth"" your middle name? Then you are a good fit and you can be one of us. You can work remotely or from one of our local offices. The salary starts at €3,000 based on your experience level.

About your role and the team:

The Application Platform team empowers other engineering teams to build their services effectively and with security and compliance built-in by designing, implementing, and maintaining the magic solid foundations and the core frameworks of the Bloomreach Engagement.

Examples of the initiatives driven by this team are:
Integrated zero-trust authentication and authorization management system.
Platform for collecting and processing audit logs in a distributed environment.
Notification center, which allows other teams to communicate information to customers through a single unified channel (upcoming project).

What you might like about this role:
Wide reach - we deal with teams across the company - product, security, architects, engineers, even customers.
Security perspective will be a key element of your day-to-day work
Developing Cloud Native services consumed by customers as well as other engineering teams

What your typical day might look like:

You start your day with a code review of your colleague’s tasks while sipping a cup of fresh-brewed tea or coffee, looking for any signs of problems and possible optimizations. Then you join your teammates on a quick daily standup, where you discuss what you’re currently working on and the plan for the next few days.

After the meeting, you get into “the zone” and spend a few undisturbed hours working on the new authentication framework while making sure it’s safely covered by a suite of unit tests. With a few clicks you quickly spin up a brand new instance of the system in the development cluster, deploy your change and notify the frontend engineer that it’s ready.

You grab a snack and take a little break from coding. Instead, you help a fellow backend engineer from another team figure out the best way to integrate their new service with the audit logging platform. In the meantime the frontend engineer gets back to you and confirms that all the new endpoints work as expected, so you create a merge request and ask your teammates for a code review. It’s a complex piece of code, so you go through it together.

After your code is approved, you merge it, automatically deploying it to the staging environment where it receives further testing by the QA team and automated integration tests before being released to production.

You end your day in a short meeting with a product manager and the director of engineering, where you flesh out the idea you had over lunch yesterday for a new approach to release management that would make the whole process even faster.

Our tech stack:
Python & Go
MongoDB, Redis, Apache Kafka
Kubernetes (GKE)
Various Google Cloud Platform services (Pub/Sub, BigTable, DataFlow, ...)
Gitlab CI/CD, Prometheus and Grafana

What we expect of the candidate:

The ideal candidate has:
At least 3 year experience developing in Python or Golang
Designing and implementing production-grade REST APIs
Having experience with operating services in production is beneficial
A working understanding of fundamental web security principles (OWASP), Authentication and Authorization practices
Experience with database systems of different kinds (MongoDB, Redis, Apache Kafka)

Regional benefits:
Monthly lunch entitlement by up to 110€ per month
Pension scheme or Health insurance depending on region

Our mission is to reinvent the way companies manage their open source information systems - on public clouds and in their own data centres. To achieve that we are building a new community around Python opscode for open source applications, running on Kubernetes. We want to move all of Canonical and Ubuntu IS onto this new, open source codebase.

We are confident that we can dramatically improve the experience of running complex business operations - and then we can help our customers embrace those new techniques and products. Traditionally, IS is an inward-facing operation. We would like to transform our IS team into an extension of the product engineering capability at Canonical. Our internal workloads are in many cases the same open source workloads that our customers want to operate. This team will productise those workloads for real-time automated operations on Kubernetes.

This role is ideal for software engineers who enjoy Python, have a passion for distributed systems, and an interest in the entire Linux stack - from kernel to networking to virtualization and containers. It is a role that requires rigour in both code and customer interactions. Our engineers are technically astute open source enthusiasts who are excited about cloud computing and are ready to join a global team charged with delivering world class services to our customers.

Strong Python development skills and familiarity with Kubernetes are key requirements of this role. You'll work closely with other teams in Canonical to ensure your products operate reliably, efficiently and scale to production sized workloads for our customers looking to adopt cutting-edge technology. You will participate and be responsible for ensuring sound software architecture and follow best practices in software quality, testing and documentation.

What you'll do
Work in Python to design and deliver open source software operations code
Work across the entire Linux stack, from kernel, networking, storage, to applications
Learn to think rigorously about application and infrastructure reliability
Shape high quality open source monitoring and alerting infrastructure
Simplify open source operations for our customers and open source community
Demonstrate sound engineering design and testing principles in your code
Follow agile software development practices
Coach and develop your colleagues where you have insights
Grow a healthy, collaborative engineering culture in line with company values
Work from home with global travel once or twice a year for up to 2 weeks for events

Who you are
You love technology and working with brilliant people
You have a Bachelor's or equivalent in Computer Science, STEM or similar degree
You are experienced with Linux systems administration, package management, and operations
You have hands-on experience with at least one public cloud
You are familiar with Docker and Kubernetes
You are an excellent Python programmer and enjoy challenging projects
You understand the importance of reliable software and strive to design and code to that expectation
You are organized and want your team to deliver timely, high quality software

Canonical is building a comprehensive automation suite to deliver a multi-cloud and on-premise data solution for the enterprise, which spans the full range of data stores and data technologies from big data, with Yugabyte, Spark and Kafka, through NoSQL and cache-layer capabilities like Redis, MongoDB and Opensearch, all the way to structured SQL engines like PostgreSQL and MySQL.

This is an exceptional opportunity for an experienced software engineer passionate about delivering high quality, reliable and automated infrastructure based on open source software running on Kubernetes, the public cloud and bare-metal. We are facing the challenge of fault-tolerant mission critical distributed systems and intend to deliver the world's best automation solution for delivering data platforms.

Experience using data platform tools is desirable, but not over hands-on experience installing, configuring and operating such technologies.

Applicants should be passionate about the future of the software defined datacenter, automation, distributed systems, and open source.

Our mission is to reinvent the way companies manage their open source information systems - on public clouds and in their own data centres. To achieve that we are building a new community around Python opscode for open source applications, running on Kubernetes. We want to move all of Canonical and Ubuntu IS onto this new, open source codebase.

We are confident that we can dramatically improve the experience of running complex business operations - and then we can help our customers embrace those new techniques and products. Traditionally, IS is an inward-facing operation. We would like to transform our IS team into an extension of the product engineering capability at Canonical.

You will participate and be responsible for ensuring sound software architecture and follow best practices in software quality, testing and documentation.

What you'll do
Work in Python to design and deliver open source software operations code
Work across the entire Linux stack, from kernel, networking, storage, to applications
Learn to think rigorously about application and infrastructure reliability
Shape high quality open source monitoring and alerting infrastructure
Simplify open source operations for our customers and open source community
Demonstrate sound engineering design and testing principles in your code
Follow agile software development practices
Coach and develop your colleagues where you have insights
Grow a healthy, collaborative engineering culture in line with company values
Work from home with global travel once or twice a year for up to 2 weeks for events

Who you are
You love technology and working with brilliant people
You have a Bachelor's or equivalent in Computer Science, STEM or similar degree
You are experienced with Linux systems administration, package management, and operations
You have hands-on experience with at least one public cloud
You are familiar with Docker and Kubernetes
You are an excellent Python programmer and enjoy challenging projects
You understand the importance of reliable software and strive to design and code to that expectation
You are organized and want your team to deliver timely, high quality software

Microsoft specific frameworks/solutions like MVC, WebAPI, Razor
Javascript frameworks like AngularJS, NodeJS, React, Vue
Experience with an enterprise level search systems e.g. Solr, Elasticsearch

Being effective in software delivery isn’t all about the code, we’ll be looking to see good experience and awareness across many of the following areas:

leading cross-functional teams using Scrum and/or Kanban
preparing and participating in workshops to identify and define user requirements
developing highly interactive websites and familiarity with the challenges involved
working in multi-disciplinary teams
working with cloud technologies such as Azure
working in projects where Test Driven Development, Behavior Driven Development, pair programming and refactoring principles were applied
full project life cycle including analysis, design, development, deployment, testing and support

What else do we expect from you?

Minimum 3 years working in a similar position, preferably in an agency setting. Overall experience in the described space at least 6 years.
Excellent written and oral communication skills as applied to user guides and documentation and to communicate clearly with developers, project managers, clients and end-users.
You speak fluent German and English, as these are the languages you use to communicate with international colleagues and customers on a daily basis.
Not all of the points mentioned so far apply to you? Never mind! Apply anyway if you are eager to work on ""digital transformation"" with customers and colleagues. You can learn what you don't know yet in our internal training courses.

What do we offer in return?

A permanent position in a globally active digital agency that is listed in the Top 10 in Germany.
We place great value on diversity and inclusion and want to create a fair and livable working environment. To achieve this, we support all people regardless of their origin and background. Everyone should feel comfortable enough to develop, grow and achieve their goals - whatever they may be.
You can expect a highly professional working environment where team spirit and knowledge transfer are not empty phrases and where flat hierarchies really pay off.
Our centrally located offices are adapted to our hybrid way of working and offer you the perfect balance to working from home.
Our working hours and home office arrangements are flexible and based on a 40-hour week and 30 days of annual leave.
In addition to a fixed salary, you will also receive a variable salary component that is paid out monthly based on company targets.
We also pay a company pension allowance.
We keep you fit: Whether through snacks, the possibility of the JobRad or the offer of the Urban Sports Club.
Continuous learning is important to us - through the Valtech Academy, at external training courses or at conferences.
A highlight for all Valtechies are the joint celebrations during the year, which you should definitely not miss.

Our mission is to reinvent the way companies manage their open source information systems - on public clouds and in their own data centres. To achieve that we are building a new community around Python opscode for open source applications, running on Kubernetes. We want to move all of Canonical and Ubuntu IS onto this new, open source codebase.

We are confident that we can dramatically improve the experience of running complex business operations - and then we can help our customers embrace those new techniques and products. Traditionally, IS is an inward-facing operation. We would like to transform our IS team into an extension of the product engineering capability at Canonical. Our internal workloads are in many cases the same open source workloads that our customers want to operate. This team will productise those workloads for real-time automated operations on Kubernetes.

This role is ideal for software engineers who enjoy Python, have a passion for distributed systems, and an interest in the entire Linux stack - from kernel to networking to virtualization and containers. It is a role that requires rigour in both code and customer interactions. Our engineers are technically astute open source enthusiasts who are excited about cloud computing and are ready to join a global team charged with delivering world class services to our customers.

Strong Python development skills and familiarity with Kubernetes are key requirements of this role. You'll work closely with other teams in Canonical to ensure your products operate reliably, efficiently and scale to production sized workloads for our customers looking to adopt cutting-edge technology. You will participate and be responsible for ensuring sound software architecture and follow best practices in software quality, testing and documentation.

What you'll do
Work in Python to design and deliver open source software operations code
Work across the entire Linux stack, from kernel, networking, storage, to applications
Learn to think rigorously about application and infrastructure reliability
Shape high quality open source monitoring and alerting infrastructure
Simplify open source operations for our customers and open source community
Demonstrate sound engineering design and testing principles in your code
Follow agile software development practices
Coach and develop your colleagues where you have insights
Grow a healthy, collaborative engineering culture in line with company values
Work from home with global travel once or twice a year for up to 2 weeks for events

Who you are
You love technology and working with brilliant people
You have a Bachelor's or equivalent in Computer Science, STEM or similar degree
You are experienced with Linux systems administration, package management, and operations
You have hands-on experience with at least one public cloud
You are familiar with Docker and Kubernetes
You are an excellent Python programmer and enjoy challenging projects
You understand the importance of reliable software and strive to design and code to that expectation
You are organized and want your team to deliver timely, high quality software

About Canonical

Canonical is a growing international software company that works with the open-source community to deliver Ubuntu, ""the world's best free software platform"". Our mission is to realise the potential of free software in the lives of individuals and organisations. Our services are helping individuals and businesses worldwide to reduce costs, improve efficiency and enhance security with Ubuntu.

We are proud to foster a workplace free from discrimination. Diversity of experience, perspectives, and background create a better work environment and better products. Whatever your identity we will give your application fair consideration.

About Us:

Consensus is a top place to work due to the incredible culture our employees have created. We strive to provide an opportunity to work with a great team with a compelling product with the objective that adding value in your work life fuels the rest of your life. We know that a winning company is built on the efforts of its people, and that’s an environment we foster at Consensus. We encourage every employee to bring their authentic self to work and take ownership of their position and their career. We strive to give our employees everything they need to make meaningful contributions to the overall success of our company. We’re looking for go-getters that are excited to thrive in a company going through an exciting growth phase!

We are a fast-growing SaaS company based in the United States. We are changing the way the world buys enterprise software. We do this by providing intelligent demo automation software that helps you scale Presales. How does this work?

We believe buying enterprise software should be simple, pleasant, and fast instead of complex, painful, and slow (which is how it is today). Buyers now want instant access to presales (sales engineering) resources throughout the buying experience but they find it harder and harder to get what they need. Using Consensus, a sales engineering team builds a library of reusable interactive video demos that Sales sends out on-demand. Consensus automatically personalizes the experience and tracks engagement as the prospect shares the demo with other stakeholders in the buying group, bringing the entire buying group to live demos better educated and ready to talk specifics.

This not only reduces unqualified demos to near zero and can double the presales team’s productivity, it also removes the ""demo lag time"" for prospects and shortens the sales cycle by as much as 68%.

Our Values:

Our values are extremely important to us and we hope that they mean something to you too. We want everyone to bring their authentic selves to work every day. We hope you can help us continue to grow without having to be perfect, but willing to put your name on something knowing it is a “version one”. Everyone here takes total ownership and accountability, because owning our outcomes means making a real contribution. We also believe in a “no peacemongering” principle. We know our path to success is hard and we don’t hesitate to ask hard things of others. We are respectfully confrontational to one another and ask direct accountability questions.

About the Role:

We are seeking a programmatic and declarative developer who wants to expand their coding skills by working with a passionate Salesforce team in a growing company. You might be excited to use or learn to use Salesforce CPQ, Experience/Sales/Service Clouds, API’s.

The Role

We are looking for a virtual PMO Group Leader that will be part of the management team of the Solera Global Project Management Office (PMO) and lead a team of project management professionals that will specifically have a focus on projects related to products that Solera markets to its clientele internationally (i.e., outside of North America).

In addition, the PMO Group Leader will establish a hierarchical project management structure that will facilitate multiple levels of project status reporting and issue escalation including, at minimum, project, portfolio, and group level. As such it is critical that the PMO Group Leader is highly skilled, experienced, and competent in acting in a group-level oversight role of multiple project portfolios and thus can act in an effective role of oversight, advisement, selective intervention to assist in issue resolution where needed, and as a final point of escalation of issues within the group to attempt to resolve with escalation further up the management chain only on rare occasion when necessary. These job requirements necessitate an individual with several years of successful hand-on experience in managing projects consisting of varying business needs, technologies, stakeholders, levels of complexity, and problem-solving. The PMO Group Leader will require a history of competency and accomplishment in the exact roles of the team members, as they will depend on their manager for expert-level guidance, direction, advisement, and support in successfully managing their own projects. The PMO Group Leader’s overall mission is to manage a group that consistently demonstrates and is reputable in an ability to deliver critical projects of various types, meeting business expectations, and most importantly successfully delivering the intended and expected results, with solid communication and transparency every step of the way.

Be able to speak in a thorough, substantive, and accurate manner about the projects under the group’s management responsibility and serve as an effective point of communication of status, as well as escalation of issues to leadership outside the group as needed
Act as an effective backstop for issue resolution and problem-solving related to projects under management responsibility of the group, ensuring that escalations beyond the group on only on rare occasion – the PMO Group Leader should be able to advise, direct, and assist as needed to resolve the majority of issues that are raised for any given project
Collaborate with other PMO leadership to formulate new processes, reengineer existing ones, as well as define and propagate best practices and standard procedures related to project management across Solera
Collaborate with other PMO leadership as needed to establish an effective management model for PMO resource sharing and cross-utilization, as well as resource accountability not only to their direct manager but also a dotted line to their stakeholders (e.g., portfolio managers, product managers, etc.)
Act as a point of escalation for stakeholders regarding any projects within the management responsibility of the group
Serve in administrative management capacity to team members, collaborating and advising them in career planning and management, as well as performance evaluations, and recognition of accomplishments

What You’ll Bring
Bachelor's degree (BS/BA) in a related field of study; Masters in a related field is a plus
10+ years experience of project, program, and project portfolio management experience, particularly in software and information technology in a wide breadth of size & complexity
5+ years experience in the design & definition of project management processes, procedures, and standard practices for an organization
5+ years experience in an agile development environment
5+ years of industry-standard tool usage related to project management and agile development

Be collaborative in nature with employees, management peers, customers, stakeholders, and all levels of management
Be oriented toward making clear agreements in every aspect of the job, with employees, management, peers, and stakeholders
Create structure where this is none and articulate and establish it in an effective manner so it is recognized and adopted
Lead the team and teach them how to effectively lead – not chase – their projects
Base decisions and judgments strictly on facts – not conjecture, supposition, or hearsay – and perform the legwork to get the facts needed for every situation
Resolve conflict or disagreement among team members, peers, management, stakeholders in a respectful fashion and with the perspectives in mind of not just yourself but of all those involved
Be proactive in problem-solving; treating risk management as the key to minimal problems, obstacles, & blockers that can occur in project execution and teach the team to think and to act in that fashion and modeling the behavior for them
Be accountable, trustworthy, direct, and objective in fulfillment of job expectations, deliverables, performance, and results of the team that they are in charge of
Be able to operate and thrive in an environment that is challenging and can change frequently with aggressive objectives to meet and complex problems to overcome
Manage employees in a fair, consistent, transparent, objective, and constructive fashion, with a genuine interest and investment in their success and career growth, as well as the benefit of your years of experience and insight
Be process oriented and recognize the importance of standardization for repeatability, consistency, and maturity of our project management capabilities across the organization
Be calm and collected under pressure, and as a result keep your employees also calm and collected
