Produktvision & Stakeholder-Kommunikation

Ein Produkt braucht eine mittel- bis langfristige Ausrichtung. Mit einem „Product Vision Statement“ oder der “Working Backwards Methode” beschreibst du die ideale Produktbeschaffenheit aus Sicht der Kund:innen. Das bildet die Grundlage, um die Produktziele im Unternehmen zu kommunizieren.

Produkt- & User Experience Design

Soy Víctor, cofundador de Planet 🌍, la única plataforma de automatización y gestión de precios para Shopify en español. Actualmente contamos con más de 500 clientes, con presencia en ¡+65 países diferentes!

Por ello, estamos ampliando nuestro equipo con un programador Front-end para el desarrollo de nuevas funcionalidades para nuestra plataforma. 💻🤙🏻

Qué ofrecemos:
Una oportunidad de escapar de los desarrollos monolíticos. Cada mes lanzamos una funcionalidad nueva, dando pie a progresar con tus conocimientos de desarrollo, y evitar la monotonía de hacer las mismas tareas una y otra vez.
Una organización horizontal donde se tienen en cuenta las diversas opiniones e ideas a la hora de tomar decisiones.
Un entorno de trabajo distendido al máximo. Nos consideramos una familia, y basamos nuestra cultura en la confianza y la cercanía 😊.
El mejor sitio para crecer. Avanzamos rápido, experimentando y aprendiendo juntos.
Horario flexible elegido por la persona. Trabajo por sprints, basado en metodología Scrum.
Salario: 23-27k€ anuales.

Qué puedes esperar de tus primeros meses en Planet:
El primer mes te pondrás a punto para poder desarrollar: aprenderás a usar nuestra plataforma y conocerás sus puntos fuertes y mejorables, prepararás tu entorno de desarrollo y aprenderás a usar las herramientas que tenemos en Front. Podrás ver cómo nos coordinamos e incluso haber colaborado en alguna tarea de desarrollo menor.
En el segundo mes habrás desplegado cambios menores en nuestro sistema de diseño y nuestras extensiones de Shopify con la ayuda de tu mentor.
En el tercer mes te habrás enfrentado a una tarea de desarrollo dentro de nuestra plataforma y para las extensiones de Shopify. Será un mes donde experimentarás a fondo con los stacks de cada entorno.
Al cabo de seis meses esperamos que ya sepas qué se puede y no se puede hacer con la API de Shopify, que participes en el diseño de nuevos addons y que puedas afrontar nuevos desarrollos en la plataforma (siempre con la ayuda de tus compañeros :)).
El objetivo final es que con el tiempo lideres el desarrollos de addons para la sección de automatizaciones, proponiendo soluciones que se adapten a los requisitos y limitaciones de Shopify.

Requisitos técnicos:
Conocimientos demostrables en el desarrollo con Angular o dos años de experiencia laboral en desarrollo web.
El prototipado se desarrolla en Figma y se maqueta en HTML5 y SCSS. Disponemos de una línea de diseño para simplificar este proceso.
Conocimientos básicos de patrones de diseño e interés por desarrollar código que sea fácil de mantener.
La mayor parte de los desarrollos parten de cero, por lo que priman las buenas prácticas. Esto permite ir actualizando las versiones sobre una base sólida y robusta para todo el equipo.
Experiencia con Git.
Conocimientos básicos de MongoDB.
MongoDB es nuestro motor de BBDD principal por lo que cualquier funcionalidad que desarrolles pasará por comunicarte con ella.
Para pruebas, debbuging e incidencias será necesario consultar directamente a la base de datos, por lo que, si tienes experiencia previa te resultará de gran ayuda.
No es necesario conocer todas las tecnologías de nuestro stack, pero sí especial interés por aprender y trabajar con ellas. En el día a día, desarrollarás en Angular@14, pero entrarás en contacto con nuestra infraestructura de AWS, sistema de logs y demás tecnologías.

También, es deseable:
Nos gustan las personas resolutivas, que no tengan miedo a enfrentarse a nuevas situaciones y a trabajar desde la terminal.
El interés por explorar todos los campos y tecnologías es algo esencial; siempre estamos buscando cómo optimizar nuestros procesos, aunque implique integrarnos con otras plataformas o usar otras librerías.
El inglés es algo esencial. Desarrollarás funcionalidad para una plataforma que se usa por todo el mundo; por lo que ayudar en la internacionalización de los textos y tener en cuenta el formateo de números y moneda es parte del día a día."

Inscribe is a Series B company backed by $38M in venture capital from seasoned Silicon Valley investors like Threshold Ventures, Crosslink Capital, Uncork Capital, and Y Combinator, along with angel investors including Box co-founder Dylan Smith and Intercom co-founder Des Traynor.

We’re on a mission to create a fair and efficient financial services ecosystem — one that grants more access to “thin file” customers (who have traditionally been left behind) while keeping fraudsters out. Companies that use Inscribe are able to grow faster, reduce fraud, and serve more customers with a better experience.

It’s a lofty goal, but one that our team of kind, funny, and wildly talented people from across the globe are committed to. We put people first by fostering an environment that is inclusive of diverse backgrounds, encouraging a sustainable work-life balance, and ensuring our team members have the resources and support to grow. Plus, our work anniversary gifts can’t be beat: poems, portraits, and (yes, it’s true) custom crossword puzzles created in your honor.

What about our company values? We’re glad you asked:
We’re builders: We create things that move society forward and let our work speak for itself.
We’re here to win: We know where we’re going, and nothing will stop us from getting there.
We’re kind: We’re human. We crave to understand others and to be understood.
We have fun: We believe joy unlocks curiosity, creativity, and connection.

We work with some of the fastest-growing fintechs in the world, such as TripActions, Ramp, Bluevine, Shift, and more. While we’re a remote-first company, we have HQs in San Francisco and Dublin, Ireland.

The Opportunity

As a ML Engineer at Inscribe you’ll apply your technical knowledge to solve real customer problems. You’ll join the Fraud team working on our core fraud detection logic and building new technical solutions to uncover fraud. You’ll work closely with product managers, designers, machine learning experts and other engineers. You will be responsible for creating new methods of detecting fraud and tuning models to stay one step ahead of the fraudsters.

Tiimiläisiämme työskentelee Digian toimipisteissä mm. Helsingissä, Tampereella, Turussa, Jyväskylässä ja Oulussa; tiimimme toimii virtuaalisesti ympäri Suomen. Työtä on mahdollista tehdä etänä, mutta kokoonnumme säännöllisesti tapaamaan toisiamme myös kasvokkain.

Meillä pääset osaksi Digian noin 1400 hengen osaajajoukkoa, jossa ihmiset kohdataan ihmisinä. Olemme kannattavasti kasvava kotimainen yhtiö, joten voimme rakentaa monenlaisia polkuja urallesi ja yksilölliselle kehittymisellesi laajan ja modernin teknologiavalikoiman parissa. Opimme koko ajan lisää yhdessä ja jokainen digialainen on asenteeltaan Senior Trainee. Työt tulevat valmiiksi, mutta me emme!

Oppiminen on yksi Digian keskeisimmistä kulttuuriperiaatteista ja meiltä löytyy esimeriksi aktiivista heimotoimintaa, josta saat vertaistukea, oppeja sekä mahdollisuuden jakaa ajatuksia eri aiheiden ympäriltä. Täältä pääset tutustumaan myös työsuhde-etuihimme.

Hakuaika päättyy 5.3.2023! Hakemus kannattaa kuitenkin laittaa tulemaan mahdollisimman pian, sillä käsittelemme hakemuksia jo hakuaikana ja sopivan henkilön löytyessä työ on mahdollista aloittaa nopeastikin.

Jos sinulle tuli mieleen kysymyksiä tehtävästä tai meillä työskentelystä, ota yhteyttä rekry@digia.com. Odotamme jo sinua!

Overstory's mission is to help solve our climate crisis by providing real-time intelligence about the planet's vegetation. In our first step toward this mission, we are applying machine learning to satellite imagery to track forests and vegetation, helping to reduce the risk of wildfires and power outages.

We have already proven our business model and we're all united behind our ambitious vision to scale up this model to help humanity and the planet. We recently raised a round of funding, led by Convective Capital. Other investors include: B Capital Group, Moxxie Ventures, Capital T, Pale Blue Dot and many other climate-focussed investors.

If you want to have a real impact and solve some of the world's most complex challenges with advanced technology, come work with our talented and passionate team. Overstory is based in Amsterdam but we are a remote-first company, with people living all over the U.S. and Europe.

About The Role

We are looking for a Principal Data Scientist who is a creative, but pragmatic, problem-solver. Reporting into VP Engineering you will be the most senior Data Scientist on the team. You'll spend most of your time working autonomously or within a small team, building, improving, and running our models. You will work closely with the CTO setting, planning, and executing the long-term vision for our ML platform.

This is a hands-on role that will involve exploring satellite imagery sets and other geographical datasets; using machine learning to analyze the images; and working with the teams to deliver the results to our customers. We have models and pipelines at various stages of maturity and we would expect you to use and apply the results of the stable ones and help us improve and validate the ones still in early development. You will work with the team to implement new ML techniques, models, and algorithms that bring step changes to our analyses.

Big part of the role is using the outputs of our analyses to solve customer needs. You will work closely with our Customer Success team to understand the customers' problems and then work with other Data Scientists and the rest of the tech team to come up with solutions to those problems. You will help us adapt our models to different customer needs, but also environmental and vegetative factors.

On a typical day you could be: running inference on satellite imagery, checking the quality of the output, tweaking the input parameters, and retraining the model with new labels; writing Python code to process and analyze GIS data; researching and incorporating new datasets into your project and sharing findings with the team; reading about the latest Deep Learning techniques and applying them to our datasets.

You will have responsibility for your own projects, and we'll expect you to take initiative to help us improve overall. Whether the work is about forest damage detection, tree species identification or biodiversity monitoring, you are up for the challenge!

About You
You are creative and curious.
You are pragmatic, you know when a simple solution is sufficient or when new model development is required.
You are a strong communicator, able to express your ideas succinctly. You make complex ideas accessible to others.
You have an eye for quality, your work is thorough, and you pay attention to both the small details and the larger picture.

You have a Bachelor's or equivalent in Computer Science, STEM or similar degree
You are experienced with Linux systems administration, package management, and operations
You have hands-on experience with at least one public cloud
You are familiar with Docker and Kubernetes
You are an excellent Python programmer and enjoy challenging projects
You understand the importance of reliable software and strive to design and code to that expectation
You are organized and want your team to deliver timely, high quality software

Status is building the tools and infrastructure for the advancement of a secure, private, and open web3.

With the high level goals of preserving the right to privacy, mitigating the risk of censorship, and promoting economic trade in a transparent, open manner, Status is building a community where anyone is welcome to join and contribute.

As an organization, Status seeks to push the web3 ecosystem forward through research, creation of developer tools, and support of the open source community.

As a product, Status is an open source, Ethereum-based app that gives users the power to chat, transact, and access a revolutionary world of DApps on the decentralized web. But Status is also building foundational infrastructure for the whole Ethereum ecosystem, including the Nimbus ETH 1.0 and 2.0 clients, the Keycard hardware wallet, and the Waku messaging protocol (a continuation of Whisper).

As a team, Status has been completely distributed since inception. Our team is currently 150+ core contributors strong, and welcomes a growing number of community members from all walks of life, scattered all around the globe.

Nimbus is a research team that focuses on developing an Ethereum client and library targeting both Ethereum and the upcoming, proof-of-stake-based ETH2. We believe that the largest deployment of Ethereum will potentially be on embedded systems, Nimbus will be designed to perform well on embedded, mobile, and generally resource-restricted devices. The extensible, configurable, and modular design of Nimbus will make it production ready for Web 3.0 and will ensure that it can be supported and maintained across all goals of Ethereum 2.0.

Building the stack from the ground up, we're translating the latest Ethereum 2.0 research into practical, performant and reusable libraries to provide fertile exploration ground for further R&D. Check our latest update!
