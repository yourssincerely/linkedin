Soy Víctor, cofundador de Planet 🌍, la única plataforma de automatización y gestión de precios para Shopify en español. Actualmente contamos con más de 500 clientes, con presencia en ¡+65 países diferentes!

Por ello, estamos ampliando nuestro equipo con un programador Front-end para el desarrollo de nuevas funcionalidades para nuestra plataforma. 💻🤙🏻

Qué ofrecemos:
Una oportunidad de escapar de los desarrollos monolíticos. Cada mes lanzamos una funcionalidad nueva, dando pie a progresar con tus conocimientos de desarrollo, y evitar la monotonía de hacer las mismas tareas una y otra vez.
Una organización horizontal donde se tienen en cuenta las diversas opiniones e ideas a la hora de tomar decisiones.
Un entorno de trabajo distendido al máximo. Nos consideramos una familia, y basamos nuestra cultura en la confianza y la cercanía 😊.
El mejor sitio para crecer. Avanzamos rápido, experimentando y aprendiendo juntos.
Horario flexible elegido por la persona. Trabajo por sprints, basado en metodología Scrum.
Salario: 23-27k€ anuales.

Qué puedes esperar de tus primeros meses en Planet:
El primer mes te pondrás a punto para poder desarrollar: aprenderás a usar nuestra plataforma y conocerás sus puntos fuertes y mejorables, prepararás tu entorno de desarrollo y aprenderás a usar las herramientas que tenemos en Front. Podrás ver cómo nos coordinamos e incluso haber colaborado en alguna tarea de desarrollo menor.
En el segundo mes habrás desplegado cambios menores en nuestro sistema de diseño y nuestras extensiones de Shopify con la ayuda de tu mentor.
En el tercer mes te habrás enfrentado a una tarea de desarrollo dentro de nuestra plataforma y para las extensiones de Shopify. Será un mes donde experimentarás a fondo con los stacks de cada entorno.
Al cabo de seis meses esperamos que ya sepas qué se puede y no se puede hacer con la API de Shopify, que participes en el diseño de nuevos addons y que puedas afrontar nuevos desarrollos en la plataforma (siempre con la ayuda de tus compañeros :)).
El objetivo final es que con el tiempo lideres el desarrollos de addons para la sección de automatizaciones, proponiendo soluciones que se adapten a los requisitos y limitaciones de Shopify.

Requisitos técnicos:
Conocimientos demostrables en el desarrollo con Angular o dos años de experiencia laboral en desarrollo web.
El prototipado se desarrolla en Figma y se maqueta en HTML5 y SCSS. Disponemos de una línea de diseño para simplificar este proceso.
Conocimientos básicos de patrones de diseño e interés por desarrollar código que sea fácil de mantener.
La mayor parte de los desarrollos parten de cero, por lo que priman las buenas prácticas. Esto permite ir actualizando las versiones sobre una base sólida y robusta para todo el equipo.
Experiencia con Git.
Conocimientos básicos de MongoDB.
MongoDB es nuestro motor de BBDD principal por lo que cualquier funcionalidad que desarrolles pasará por comunicarte con ella.
Para pruebas, debbuging e incidencias será necesario consultar directamente a la base de datos, por lo que, si tienes experiencia previa te resultará de gran ayuda.
No es necesario conocer todas las tecnologías de nuestro stack, pero sí especial interés por aprender y trabajar con ellas. En el día a día, desarrollarás en Angular@14, pero entrarás en contacto con nuestra infraestructura de AWS, sistema de logs y demás tecnologías.

También, es deseable:
Nos gustan las personas resolutivas, que no tengan miedo a enfrentarse a nuevas situaciones y a trabajar desde la terminal.
El interés por explorar todos los campos y tecnologías es algo esencial; siempre estamos buscando cómo optimizar nuestros procesos, aunque implique integrarnos con otras plataformas o usar otras librerías.
El inglés es algo esencial. Desarrollarás funcionalidad para una plataforma que se usa por todo el mundo; por lo que ayudar en la internacionalización de los textos y tener en cuenta el formateo de números y moneda es parte del día a día."

To achieve that we are building a new community around Python opscode for open source applications, running on Kubernetes. We want to move all of Canonical and Ubuntu IS onto this new, open source codebase.

We are confident that we can dramatically improve the experience of running complex business operations - and then we can help our customers embrace those new techniques and products. Traditionally, IS is an inward-facing operation. We would like to transform our IS team into an extension of the product engineering capability at Canonical. Our internal workloads are in many cases the same open source workloads that our customers want to operate. This team will productise those workloads for real-time automated operations on Kubernetes.

This role is ideal for software engineers who enjoy Python, have a passion for distributed systems, and an interest in the entire Linux stack - from kernel to networking to virtualization and containers. It is a role that requires rigour in both code and customer interactions. Our engineers are technically astute open source enthusiasts who are excited about cloud computing and are ready to join a global team charged with delivering world class services to our customers.

Strong Python development skills and familiarity with Kubernetes are key requirements of this role. You'll work closely with other teams in Canonical to ensure your products operate reliably, efficiently and scale to production sized workloads for our customers looking to adopt cutting-edge technology. You will participate and be responsible for ensuring sound software architecture and follow best practices in software quality, testing and documentation.

What you'll do
Work in Python to design and deliver open source software operations code
Work across the entire Linux stack, from kernel, networking, storage, to applications
Learn to think rigorously about application and infrastructure reliability
Shape high quality open source monitoring and alerting infrastructure
Simplify open source operations for our customers and open source community
Demonstrate sound engineering design and testing principles in your code
Follow agile software development practices
Coach and develop your colleagues where you have insights
Grow a healthy, collaborative engineering culture in line with company values
Work from home with global travel once or twice a year for up to 2 weeks for events

Who you are
You love technology and working with brilliant people

Meillä pääset osaksi Digian noin 1400 hengen osaajajoukkoa, jossa ihmiset kohdataan ihmisinä. Olemme kannattavasti kasvava kotimainen yhtiö, joten voimme rakentaa monenlaisia polkuja urallesi ja yksilölliselle kehittymisellesi laajan ja modernin teknologiavalikoiman parissa. Opimme koko ajan lisää yhdessä ja jokainen digialainen on asenteeltaan Senior Trainee. Työt tulevat valmiiksi, mutta me emme!

Oppiminen on yksi Digian keskeisimmistä kulttuuriperiaatteista ja meiltä löytyy esimeriksi aktiivista heimotoimintaa, josta saat vertaistukea, oppeja sekä mahdollisuuden jakaa ajatuksia eri aiheiden ympäriltä. Täältä pääset tutustumaan myös työsuhde-etuihimme.

Hakuaika päättyy 5.3.2023! Hakemus kannattaa kuitenkin laittaa tulemaan mahdollisimman pian, sillä käsittelemme hakemuksia jo hakuaikana ja sopivan henkilön löytyessä työ on mahdollista aloittaa nopeastikin.

Overstory's mission is to help solve our climate crisis by providing real-time intelligence about the planet's vegetation. In our first step toward this mission, we are applying machine learning to satellite imagery to track forests and vegetation, helping to reduce the risk of wildfires and power outages.

We have already proven our business model and we're all united behind our ambitious vision to scale up this model to help humanity and the planet. We recently raised a round of funding, led by Convective Capital. Other investors include: B Capital Group, Moxxie Ventures, Capital T, Pale Blue Dot and many other climate-focussed investors.

If you want to have a real impact and solve some of the world's most complex challenges with advanced technology, come work with our talented and passionate team. Overstory is based in Amsterdam but we are a remote-first company, with people living all over the U.S. and Europe.

About The Role

We are looking for a Principal Data Scientist who is a creative, but pragmatic, problem-solver. Reporting into VP Engineering you will be the most senior Data Scientist on the team. You'll spend most of your time working autonomously or within a small team, building, improving, and running our models. You will work closely with the CTO setting, planning, and executing the long-term vision for our ML platform.

This is a hands-on role that will involve exploring satellite imagery sets and other geographical datasets; using machine learning to analyze the images; and working with the teams to deliver the results to our customers. We have models and pipelines at various stages of maturity and we would expect you to use and apply the results of the stable ones and help us improve and validate the ones still in early development. You will work with the team to implement new ML techniques, models, and algorithms that bring step changes to our analyses.

Big part of the role is using the outputs of our analyses to solve customer needs. You will work closely with our Customer Success team to understand the customers' problems and then work with other Data Scientists and the rest of the tech team to come up with solutions to those problems. You will help us adapt our models to different customer needs, but also environmental and vegetative factors.

On a typical day you could be: running inference on satellite imagery, checking the quality of the output, tweaking the input parameters, and retraining the model with new labels; writing Python code to process and analyze GIS data; researching and incorporating new datasets into your project and sharing findings with the team; reading about the latest Deep Learning techniques and applying them to our datasets.

You will have responsibility for your own projects, and we'll expect you to take initiative to help us improve overall. Whether the work is about forest damage detection, tree species identification or biodiversity monitoring, you are up for the challenge!

About You
You are creative and curious.
You are pragmatic, you know when a simple solution is sufficient or when new model development is required.
You are a strong communicator, able to express your ideas succinctly. You make complex ideas accessible to others.
You have an eye for quality, your work is thorough, and you pay attention to both the small details and the larger picture.
Teamwork is at your core, and you like to help others grow and succeed.

Requirements
You have at least 8 years of commercial experience as a Data Scientist or Machine Learning Engineer.
You have spent at least 3 years working in a startup environment (preferably early stage).
You have advanced Python experience (including PyTorch and/or Tensorflow).
Experience working with GIS systems and processing GIS data.
Experience processing satellite data and/or imagery.

What You Get
To be part of truly mission-driven work that reduces wildfires, protects earth's natural resources and helps solve our climate crisis.
Flexible working environment with a lot of autonomy. We build our work days around our lives, not the other way around.
Other benefits like a remote working budget, an educational budget and time to develop new skills.
To be surrounded by an excellent, vibrant, smart team who have each other's back and believe in a culture of openness, tolerance and respect.
Equity and a competitive salary.

About Our Team

We are a group of 33 people from all over the world. Eleven nationalities are represented in our team. We work remotely from seven different countries and occasionally (optionally!) meet up for in-person collaboration.

Status is building the tools and infrastructure for the advancement of a secure, private, and open web3.

As an organization, Status seeks to push the web3 ecosystem forward through research, creation of developer tools, and support of the open source community.

As a product, Status is an open source, Ethereum-based app that gives users the power to chat, transact, and access a revolutionary world of DApps on the decentralized web. But Status is also building foundational infrastructure for the whole Ethereum ecosystem, including the Nimbus ETH 1.0 and 2.0 clients, the Keycard hardware wallet, and the Waku messaging protocol (a continuation of Whisper).

Nimbus is a research team that focuses on developing an Ethereum client and library targeting both Ethereum and the upcoming, proof-of-stake-based ETH2. We believe that the largest deployment of Ethereum will potentially be on embedded systems, Nimbus will be designed to perform well on embedded, mobile, and generally resource-restricted devices. The extensible, configurable, and modular design of Nimbus will make it production ready for Web 3.0 and will ensure that it can be supported and maintained across all goals of Ethereum 2.0.

Building the stack from the ground up, we're translating the latest Ethereum 2.0 research into practical, performant and reusable libraries to provide fertile exploration ground for further R&D. Check our latest update!

Hi, want to build out the future of content automation with us?

Storyteq is a Creative Marketing Operations Platform that empowers digital creative leads and marketing leaders, in top global brands and agencies to optimise and scale the way they create and manage digital creative assets. We believe creativity takes time, but creative production shouldn't.

Our endless curiosity and relentless commitment to our customers lies at the heart of our approach to solving problems. This common mission is weaved into our values: we take risks (be bold), thrive on change (move fast), and lead with trust (stay familiar).

About The Job

Our Mid-level Backend Engineer positions require true ‘Engineers’ with Product based mindsets. You will be joining a team of Engineers who come from backgrounds in solving complex software engineering challenges, accustomed to working in a proactive manner, identifying areas for improvement and implementing these effectively.

The role will require you to utilise your knowledge of best-practice software development principles where you can design, develop and implement new features for our SaaS platform, whilst making our product even more scalable and awesome.

Your main responsibilities:

Building new features and technological innovations in our Node.js back-end as part of one of our Development Teams
Understand and help define our platform's architecture together with the team
Challenge our product and team members to continuously develop themselves and our product

Besides fun to work with, you...

Have Node.js Development experience - essential (more than connecting an API!)
Possess a deep understanding of modern software engineering design and development principles
Can demonstrate previous experience of backend software engineering using ANY of the following: Java, C++, Python, Go, Scala
Are Experienced with modern JavaScript (ES5/ES6+)
Are great at modelling business domains into data models
Have a good understanding and experience with different database paradigms and when to use them
Have a deep understanding of APIs
You're proactive, result-driven, and excited to work in a fast-growing tech scale-up
You're a team player and like to work together to reach our goals
MUST HAVE gained Software Engineer / Development experience in a SaaS / Product based environment

Also great to have....

Experience with Node frameworks like NestJS or Express
Experience with message queues like RabbitMQ, PubSub or similar

Things we love at Storyteq:

Be entrepreneurial

We are looking for a talented software engineer to create usable, intuitive, beautiful interfaces and scalable engines for Dataiku DSS. Dataiku DSS brings together big data and AI technologies into a unique and easy-to-use platform. It allows data scientists to process data with SQL databases, Spark, and Kubernetes with either user-friendly interfaces or code. The same platform also allows business analysts to create powerful machines or deep learning models with just a few clicks.

What We Do

We design and code experiences that resonate with our growing customer base.

Write high-quality code, as your teammates do!
You are the ideal recruit if:

You have experience in software development and you are interested in data visualization tools.
You are customer-oriented — you want to understand customer needs and how the product is used.
You are at ease with both frontend and backend development, or you’ve mastered frontend development but are not afraid to dive into backend code to better understand how it works.
You know that a chart is worth a thousand grid cells.
You have firsthand experience (either professional or personal) building a real product.
You blink each time you see a misaligned pixel!
You are humble and kind. You don't hesitate to ask questions when you don't know, and you treat your colleagues with respect, kindness, and honesty.

Our customers are at the forefront of some of the most interesting data in the world, using SingleStore to push the boundaries every day. To do this well, they leverage the expertise of our Support Engineering Team, composed of technical subject matter experts on the frontlines of critical customer issues.

This Support Engineering role skews far more towards engineering than typical technical support as you will need to delve into database internals and memory allocators, diagnose complex SQL query behavior, and investigate Linux and Kubernetes related configurations, all in the name of resolving complex product issues. Our Support Engineers are constantly learning a wide range of customer systems and technical concepts and are thrilled by the new and exciting challenges that they encounter each day.

To accurately identify the source and solution of an issue, this team will take the time to learn about the customer’s business and systems while helping to improve their fundamental SingleStore and database operational knowledge. This often requires additional research and time spent on learning new technologies and tools outside of just the database engine while also being deeply engaged with multiple departments including development teams, query performance engineering, product management, infrastructure SREs, etc.

Role And Responsibilities

Provide product support to our on-premise and cloud hosted enterprise customers, acting as the first-line-of-defense for complex technical issues, bug diagnosis, or resolving critical outages.
Identify and reproduce product issues and submit formal bug reports or feature requests to the appropriate Engineering team.
Understand and help to improve complex SQL behavior to diagnose bugs or improve performance.
Collaborate with software developers, sales engineers, and technical account managers to keep all teams up to date with current issues a customer may be facing.
Work to streamline and improve various Support and Engineering processes and tools, author new knowledge base articles and run-books, and help the team continually improve efficiency and effectiveness.
Participate in our on-call rotation that may include weekends and holidays.

Required Skills And Experience

4+ years of previous customer-facing advanced technical support experience.
Previous experience as a DBA or Support Engineer at a database company.
Experience with SQL databases and advanced SQL query optimization and tuning. You should be familiar enough with at least one commercial or open source database to decipher its EXPLAIN plan and understand potential performance impact or ways to improve the query.
Strong background in general product troubleshooting, keeping in mind that query processing issues can be impacted by database or linux configuration and resource availability.
A solid linux performance background. That means you are hands-on with Linux and your skills include generating and reading flame graphs, checking system resource utilization, and parsing verbose log files. Bonus points for familiarity with Kubernetes.
Experience with a scripting or coding language. Whether it’s C++, Python, Go, or Bash, you should have a go-to solution for quick problem-solving and be able to navigate through our extensive code base.
Familiarity with distributed systems and AWS/GCP. You understand how organizations deploy and maintain distributed applications and services across multiple machines and know how to analyze these systems for performance bottlenecks.
Experience improving support processes regarding ticket triage, escalation, and reporting business metrics back to the organization.
Strong written and verbal English communication skills. Have the ability to explain technical concepts to a wide range of end-users.

SingleStore is one platform for all data, built so you can engage with insight in every moment. Trusted by industry leaders, SingleStore enables enterprises to adapt to change as it happens, embrace diverse data with ease, and accelerate the pace of innovation. SingleStore is venture-backed and headquartered in San Francisco with offices in Portland, Seattle, Boston, Bangalore, London, Lisbon, and Kyiv. Defining the future starts with The Database of Now™.

About the Project
Our client is looking for QA Networking Engineers with Test Automation and Python skillset, who are defining and maintaining the Quality Release Gate for our Customer. This Team has the ownership to define the process, debug all aspects of the Products' functionality in its release cycle and work closely together with our Test and Framework Development Team to identify root causes, raise issues accordingly to feature developers, triage problems and fix the issues inside their area of competence (the Product Testing Framework). This team also collaborates closely with the Customer's Developer Team on feature issues and thus reduces the number of flaws in the Product. The Customer relies on us to keep a healthy and real PASS rate of the tests in order to maintain a high-performance product and demonstrable quality metrics (Quality Gate). The previous in-place process was not scaling up to the agile release strategy of the Customer's products.

Thus, the ideal candidate has deep knowledge of computer networking, as well as automation skills necessary to understand and debug efficiently the various testing scenarios (strong preference is Python, as the framework and tests are written in Python).

Collaborate closely with our local team and with the Customer's team. Contribute to automated test case development and framework development when the QG is GREEN and/or workload need is low (e.g. between release-end - release-start) - to keep a flexible, challenging work content and thus keep people motivation levels high, as well as work efficiency.

Our Team has developed a state-of-the-art Auto Triage Framework, which uses advanced signature learning techniques to assist our Engineers in performing RCA and streamlining the Quality Gate process.

Join us and empower our ambitious Site Reliability Engineering team as:

Site Reliability Engineer (80% - 100%) Your mission:

As a Site Reliability Engineer for our Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) service, you empower Open Systems to deploy and operate a reliable, distributed service at scale, across multiple platforms.

You will:

Work closely with engineering teams, product owners, and other stakeholders to define service operations, identify operational issues early and prevent them
Help define Service Level Objectives to assess release readiness of all services
Develop software, tooling, and processes to automate our operations
Measure and optimize system performance
Participate in incident management on-call rotation and drive root cause analysis

At Open Systems SREs are driven by improving the operations of our services, measured by the level of service that we provide to our customers, the resources that we need to operate our services, and the interest of our operational work in our Mission Control NOC. SREs work in partnership with platform and service engineering teams in different capacity—from consulting to joint engineering projects—to drive the operational improvements across the entire lifecycle of our services.

As part of your SRE responsibilities, and through the Open Systems training and courses, you will become certified as a Mission Control Engineer, providing you with knowledge in a wide area covering networking and security topics. This will give you the opportunity to visit our Mission Control NOC in Honolulu for deployments of 2 to 3 months, where travel and accommodation is also afforded to your partner and children.

Your qualifications:

You are strong in either Software Engineering or Networking and Security Operations and have an interest in developing your skills and solving problems at the intersection of both. You are motivated to learn new skills and expand your existing theoretical and practical knowledge in training programs offered by internal domain experts and team colleagues, and ideally, you bring some of the following skills to the table:

University degree in Computer Science, or equivalent professional experience
At least 2 years of SRE, software development, DevOps, or security automation
Strong conceptional understanding of scalable system design
Full ability to design, test, and release code in general-purpose languages such as Go or Python and scripting (Bash)
Familiarity with GitOps, Terraform, Kubernetes, Prometheus, as well as major clouds (Azure, AWS, GCP...)
Interpersonal skills, ability to collaborate and build trust across teams to design and deliver shared solutions

You may already have experience with the whole breadth of the SRE role already, but do not let it stop you if you do not. We also support you making a transition to SRE from a strong skillset in software engineering, DevOps, or platform engineering. In that case you should be able to explain why would want to make this transition.

What we offer:

You will join our growing SRE team, and work with agile method in coordination with software and product engineering teams. You will have the opportunity to work remotely from Switzerland, Germany, Austria, the Netherlands, or the United States, or be based in one of our offices in Zürich, Bern, Düsseldorf, Vienna or Redwood City. You will have the option to work full-time or part-time 80%.

Open Systems will offer you interesting challenges in the dynamic and global environment of SD-WAN and cybersecurity. You will be in a work environment in which innovative solutions, rapid development times, creativity, and open communication are practiced and continuously fostered. The pursuit of technical advancement is at the center of our attention. Our employees are known as enthusiastic, humorous, and passionate individuals. It’s all about people because it’s them who make us stand out in the marketplace, not our technology.

We look forward to receiving your online application (please note that you have to compress your application into two attachments). For further questions and inquiries about applications, please feel free to contact Martin Blecher at +41 58 100 10 10. Only direct applications will be considered.

To achieve that we are building a new community around Python opscode for open source applications, running on Kubernetes. We want to move all of Canonical and Ubuntu IS onto this new, open source codebase.

We are confident that we can dramatically improve the experience of running complex business operations - and then we can help our customers embrace those new techniques and products. Traditionally, IS is an inward-facing operation. We would like to transform our IS team into an extension of the product engineering capability at Canonical.

This role is ideal for software engineers who enjoy Python, have a passion for distributed systems, and an interest in the entire Linux stack - from kernel to networking to virtualization and containers. It is a role that requires rigour in both code and customer interactions.

Strong Python development skills and familiarity with Kubernetes are key requirements of this role.

Follow agile software development practices

As an organization, Status seeks to push the web3 ecosystem forward through research, creation of developer tools, and support of the open source community.

As a product, Status is an open source, Ethereum-based app that gives users the power to chat, transact, and access a revolutionary world of DApps on the decentralized web. But Status is also building foundational infrastructure for the whole Ethereum ecosystem, including the Nimbus ETH 1.0 and 2.0 clients, the Keycard hardware wallet, and the Waku messaging protocol (a continuation of Whisper).

It offers a suite of products that drive true personalization and digital commerce growth, including:
Discovery, offering AI-driven search and merchandising
Content, offering a headless CMS

Bloomreach recently raised $175 million in a Series F funding round, bringing its total valuation to $2.2 billion. The investment was led by Goldman Sachs Asset Management with participation from Bain Capital Ventures and Sixth Street Growth. For more information, visit Bloomreach.com.

We are currently expanding our Application Platform team and we are looking for Backend Software Engineer. Is ""security"", ""curiosity"" or ""growth"" your middle name? Then you are a good fit and you can be one of us. You can work remotely or from one of our local offices. The salary starts at €3,000 based on your experience level.

About your role and the team:

The Application Platform team empowers other engineering teams to build their services effectively and with security and compliance built-in by designing, implementing, and maintaining the magic solid foundations and the core frameworks of the Bloomreach Engagement.

Examples of the initiatives driven by this team are:
Integrated zero-trust authentication and authorization management system.
Platform for collecting and processing audit logs in a distributed environment.
Notification center, which allows other teams to communicate information to customers through a single unified channel (upcoming project).

What you might like about this role:
Wide reach - we deal with teams across the company - product, security, architects, engineers, even customers.
Security perspective will be a key element of your day-to-day work
Developing Cloud Native services consumed by customers as well as other engineering teams

What your typical day might look like:

You start your day with a code review of your colleague’s tasks while sipping a cup of fresh-brewed tea or coffee, looking for any signs of problems and possible optimizations. Then you join your teammates on a quick daily standup, where you discuss what you’re currently working on and the plan for the next few days.

After the meeting, you get into “the zone” and spend a few undisturbed hours working on the new authentication framework while making sure it’s safely covered by a suite of unit tests. With a few clicks you quickly spin up a brand new instance of the system in the development cluster, deploy your change and notify the frontend engineer that it’s ready.

You grab a snack and take a little break from coding. Instead, you help a fellow backend engineer from another team figure out the best way to integrate their new service with the audit logging platform. In the meantime the frontend engineer gets back to you and confirms that all the new endpoints work as expected, so you create a merge request and ask your teammates for a code review. It’s a complex piece of code, so you go through it together.

After your code is approved, you merge it, automatically deploying it to the staging environment where it receives further testing by the QA team and automated integration tests before being released to production.

You end your day in a short meeting with a product manager and the director of engineering, where you flesh out the idea you had over lunch yesterday for a new approach to release management that would make the whole process even faster.

Our tech stack:
Python & Go
MongoDB, Redis, Apache Kafka
Kubernetes (GKE)
Various Google Cloud Platform services (Pub/Sub, BigTable, DataFlow, ...)
Gitlab CI/CD, Prometheus and Grafana

What we expect of the candidate:

The ideal candidate has:
At least 3 year experience developing in Python or Golang
Designing and implementing production-grade REST APIs
Having experience with operating services in production is beneficial
A working understanding of fundamental web security principles (OWASP), Authentication and Authorization practices
Experience with database systems of different kinds (MongoDB, Redis, Apache Kafka)

Regional benefits:
Monthly lunch entitlement by up to 110€ per month
Pension scheme or Health insurance depending on region

Telnyx is a global connectivity platform and partner that powers carrier-grade services on an in-house built, private, cloud-agnostic IP network. We power voice, messaging, video, wireless, numbering, fax, security, and networking solutions for businesses all around the world. Whether we’re processing mission-critical communications, hosting enterprise-grade contact centers, or powering simple in-app messaging and calling, our APIs make secure, high-fidelity connectivity the new standard. We’re working to democratize worldwide access to real-time communications over the internet.

The Role

We’re looking for a Mobile App Engineer to work on our iOS and Android Voice & Video SDKs, that enable our customers to add real-time communications into their apps. Telnyx’s SDKs are building blocks from which customers create voice, video and data applications of the future, leveraging our world-wide network for the highest quality real-time streaming. This role is for a seasoned engineer looking for an experience leading native mobile efforts at a fast-paced startup.

In This Role You Will

Lead Telnyx native mobile projects, starting with our Voice and Video SDKs.
Collaborate with telephony and web developers to create iOS and Android SDKs with a laser focus on developer experience.
Make improvements to native mobile projects based on early adopters feedback.
Craft durable, well-tested code with an unwavering commitment to product quality.
Create sample applications and work with our Sales Engineers to display Voice and Video applications to potential customers.
Learn the technology behind voice and video calls and how to use it to enable applications that connect people through our world-wide private network.

You’d Be A Good Fit If You Have

Experience working on challenging iOS and Android projects in an agile environment, using Swift, Objective-C, Kotlin, or Java.
Published native mobile open-source libraries.
You take a thoughtful approach to decision making, knowing when to move fast and when to long-term optimize.

What It Is Like To Work At Telnyx

Telnyx is a complex machine with a simple purpose: connect people. We are an intelligent telephony engine, the beating heart of the Telnyx service that routes data along the pathways of our global, private network. We are drop-in APIs for hooking applications into our products, and an administrator portal that puts unprecedented control of configuring and orchestrating the Telnyx service into our customers’ hands.

We’re also an organization of industry experts and engineers focused on solving problems and building solutions. We’re a concierge customer success team and a 24/7 support team. We’re a communications partner, focused on agile and endless innovation, not a telecom slogged in antiquated processes and anti-competitive regulation. We keep the conversation going: the always-on, omnichannel, enriched conversation that the modern world demands.

Communications are coming untethered from devices, and more and more, they’re migrating into our everyday platforms: our social media, our work applications, and our collaboration tools. But, that move started before there was infrastructure to support it—the modern internet will never offer the speed and consistency that real-time communications require. So, we built a network that does and a cloud platform tuned for real-time communications at every layer. Telnyx is the connective matrix, a worldwide nervous system, a high-speed rail tunneling through the information superhighway. We’re the foundation for calls, texts and messaging today, for the internet of things, augmented reality and “communitainment” tomorrow, and for whatever enterprising imaginations can dream up after that.

We’re Telnyx. We’re the future of communications.

At Telnyx, we're looking for people with passion, grit, and integrity. You're encouraged to apply even if your experience doesn't precisely match the job description. Your skills and passion will stand out—and set you apart—especially if your career has taken some extraordinary twists and turns. At Telnyx, we welcome diverse perspectives and people who think rigorously and aren't afraid to challenge assumptions. Join us.

Bring Your Authentic Self to Telnyx

Telnyx is committed to building a team full of diverse perspectives, various backgrounds and different minds. We believe diversity drives innovation. We are committed to building a culture where difference is valued and creating avenues of equity for underserved groups. While we are still a work in progress, we are actively seeking folks who are passionate about building a place of belonging for everyone.

How We Work

We’re a connectivity and networking leader, with industry experts and engineers who have built our cloud-agnostic platform in-house, from the ground up. We’re a concierge customer success team and a 24/7 support team. We’re a communications partner, focused on agile innovation, not a telecom slogged in antiquated processes and anti-competitive regulation. We’re an enterprise-grade conversation enabler, powering the global, enriched, multi-channel communications that today’s customers demand.

We're looking for people with passion, grit, and integrity. We believe in transparency, proactivity, and mutual respect. We provide the high-grade tools that help you do your best work, and keep up the collaborative habits that help everyone stay in the loop. No matter where you're based or which team you’re on, you’re plugged in, supported, and helping to shape the future of communications.

You're encouraged to apply even if your experience doesn't precisely match the job description.

Soy Víctor, cofundador de Planet 🌍, la única plataforma de automatización y gestión de precios para Shopify en español. Actualmente contamos con más de 500 clientes, con presencia en ¡+65 países diferentes!

Por ello, estamos ampliando nuestro equipo con un programador Front-end para el desarrollo de nuevas funcionalidades para nuestra plataforma. 💻🤙🏻

Qué ofrecemos:
Una oportunidad de escapar de los desarrollos monolíticos. Cada mes lanzamos una funcionalidad nueva, dando pie a progresar con tus conocimientos de desarrollo, y evitar la monotonía de hacer las mismas tareas una y otra vez.
Una organización horizontal donde se tienen en cuenta las diversas opiniones e ideas a la hora de tomar decisiones.
Un entorno de trabajo distendido al máximo. Nos consideramos una familia, y basamos nuestra cultura en la confianza y la cercanía 😊.
El mejor sitio para crecer. Avanzamos rápido, experimentando y aprendiendo juntos.
Horario flexible elegido por la persona. Trabajo por sprints, basado en metodología Scrum.
Salario: 23-27k€ anuales.

Qué puedes esperar de tus primeros meses en Planet:
El primer mes te pondrás a punto para poder desarrollar: aprenderás a usar nuestra plataforma y conocerás sus puntos fuertes y mejorables, prepararás tu entorno de desarrollo y aprenderás a usar las herramientas que tenemos en Front. Podrás ver cómo nos coordinamos e incluso haber colaborado en alguna tarea de desarrollo menor.
En el segundo mes habrás desplegado cambios menores en nuestro sistema de diseño y nuestras extensiones de Shopify con la ayuda de tu mentor.
En el tercer mes te habrás enfrentado a una tarea de desarrollo dentro de nuestra plataforma y para las extensiones de Shopify. Será un mes donde experimentarás a fondo con los stacks de cada entorno.
Al cabo de seis meses esperamos que ya sepas qué se puede y no se puede hacer con la API de Shopify, que participes en el diseño de nuevos addons y que puedas afrontar nuevos desarrollos en la plataforma (siempre con la ayuda de tus compañeros :)).
El objetivo final es que con el tiempo lideres el desarrollos de addons para la sección de automatizaciones, proponiendo soluciones que se adapten a los requisitos y limitaciones de Shopify.

Requisitos técnicos:
Conocimientos demostrables en el desarrollo con Angular o dos años de experiencia laboral en desarrollo web.
El prototipado se desarrolla en Figma y se maqueta en HTML5 y SCSS. Disponemos de una línea de diseño para simplificar este proceso.
Conocimientos básicos de patrones de diseño e interés por desarrollar código que sea fácil de mantener.
La mayor parte de los desarrollos parten de cero, por lo que priman las buenas prácticas. Esto permite ir actualizando las versiones sobre una base sólida y robusta para todo el equipo.
Experiencia con Git.
Conocimientos básicos de MongoDB.
MongoDB es nuestro motor de BBDD principal por lo que cualquier funcionalidad que desarrolles pasará por comunicarte con ella.
Para pruebas, debbuging e incidencias será necesario consultar directamente a la base de datos, por lo que, si tienes experiencia previa te resultará de gran ayuda.
No es necesario conocer todas las tecnologías de nuestro stack, pero sí especial interés por aprender y trabajar con ellas. En el día a día, desarrollarás en Angular@14, pero entrarás en contacto con nuestra infraestructura de AWS, sistema de logs y demás tecnologías.

También, es deseable:
Nos gustan las personas resolutivas, que no tengan miedo a enfrentarse a nuevas situaciones y a trabajar desde la terminal.
El interés por explorar todos los campos y tecnologías es algo esencial; siempre estamos buscando cómo optimizar nuestros procesos, aunque implique integrarnos con otras plataformas o usar otras librerías.
El inglés es algo esencial. Desarrollarás funcionalidad para una plataforma que se usa por todo el mundo; por lo que ayudar en la internacionalización de los textos y tener en cuenta el formateo de números y moneda es parte del día a día."

How do you know if you want to work at InnovationCast?

You seek to learn and want to grow personally and professionally. The real magic of innovation happens when committed people work smarter to turn ideas into new value. If we don’t become better at what we do, we won’t help our customers do the same. So if you value repetition more than discovery, this job is not for you.

You want to do work that matters for people who care. We’re a startup working to solve a big and relevant problem - one that won’t go away. Helping our customers to get better results through innovation management is - and will ever be - a work in progress. But it is so important and makes a difference for so many people, that the mission inspires you.

You welcome change and actually like to drive it. We strive to give our customers the best tools so they can keep making progress with innovation. This means that we have to experiment a lot with new ideas. As expected, some of them will work, others won’t. You need to be willing to be wrong, not afraid to make mistakes and actively learn from the process.

You don’t want to be micromanaged and want to bring actionable ideas to the team. Innovation is a team sport. Sometimes your work will seem tricky and confusing because you will be working on something that doesn’t exist yet. You will reflect on and understand our thinking and be humble to ask for help, and share difficulties and potential ways forward. But you don’t expect to be given a checklist. When you feel others may be wrong, you speak up and explain your point of view. You value honest communication.

You believe innovation and entrepreneurship can help companies change the way they work and how business is done. You may even want to become an entrepreneur. We’re set to use innovation management and entrepreneurship practices to provide software that helps companies think and act differently at scale. By opening innovation to employees, customers and partners, organizations can explore unforeseen possibilities and make real progress they couldn’t do on their own.

About InnovationCast

We’re a rapidly growing startup with an excellent SaaS product used by top brands globally. And we are on a mission to change the way organizations innovate: for better and for good. Want to join us?

InnovationCast is the collaborative innovation management software (SaaS) that helps organizations discover, incubate, and accelerate ideas. In short, we connect people and ideas and enable them to bring the best ideas to life and make a difference.

We have fantastic customers like DHL, Mayo Clinic, or Delta. We’re backed by Indico Capital, Shilling Capital and accelerated by Google for Startups.

We make innovation simpler, faster, more productive, and even fun. We believe that innovation and entrepreneurship mindsets and practices will become part of how people work daily. And we are set to make it possible and accessible for companies of all shapes and sizes.

Would you like to join a growing team and have an impact on the development of a world-class product? Do you want to work on a software used by thousands of people from top brands worldwide, which is used to innovate on new products, business models, and even social challenges? Then this job may be for you!"

Our customers are at the forefront of some of the most interesting data in the world, using SingleStore to push the boundaries every day. To do this well, they leverage the expertise of our Support Engineering Team, composed of technical subject matter experts on the frontlines of critical customer issues.

This Support Engineering role skews far more towards engineering than typical technical support as you will need to delve into database internals and memory allocators, diagnose complex SQL query behavior, and investigate Linux and Kubernetes related configurations, all in the name of resolving complex product issues. Our Support Engineers are constantly learning a wide range of customer systems and technical concepts and are thrilled by the new and exciting challenges that they encounter each day.

To accurately identify the source and solution of an issue, this team will take the time to learn about the customer’s business and systems while helping to improve their fundamental SingleStore and database operational knowledge. This often requires additional research and time spent on learning new technologies and tools outside of just the database engine while also being deeply engaged with multiple departments including development teams, query performance engineering, product management, infrastructure SREs, etc.

Role And Responsibilities

Provide product support to our on-premise and cloud hosted enterprise customers, acting as the first-line-of-defense for complex technical issues, bug diagnosis, or resolving critical outages.
Identify and reproduce product issues and submit formal bug reports or feature requests to the appropriate Engineering team.
Understand and help to improve complex SQL behavior to diagnose bugs or improve performance.
Collaborate with software developers, sales engineers, and technical account managers to keep all teams up to date with current issues a customer may be facing.
Work to streamline and improve various Support and Engineering processes and tools, author new knowledge base articles and run-books, and help the team continually improve efficiency and effectiveness.
Participate in our on-call rotation that may include weekends and holidays.

Required Skills And Experience

4+ years of previous customer-facing advanced technical support experience.
Previous experience as a DBA or Support Engineer at a database company.
Experience with SQL databases and advanced SQL query optimization and tuning. You should be familiar enough with at least one commercial or open source database to decipher its EXPLAIN plan and understand potential performance impact or ways to improve the query.
Strong background in general product troubleshooting, keeping in mind that query processing issues can be impacted by database or linux configuration and resource availability.
A solid linux performance background. That means you are hands-on with Linux and your skills include generating and reading flame graphs, checking system resource utilization, and parsing verbose log files. Bonus points for familiarity with Kubernetes.
Experience with a scripting or coding language. Whether it’s C++, Python, Go, or Bash, you should have a go-to solution for quick problem-solving and be able to navigate through our extensive code base.
Familiarity with distributed systems and AWS/GCP. You understand how organizations deploy and maintain distributed applications and services across multiple machines and know how to analyze these systems for performance bottlenecks.
Experience improving support processes regarding ticket triage, escalation, and reporting business metrics back to the organization.
Strong written and verbal English communication skills. Have the ability to explain technical concepts to a wide range of end-users.

SingleStore is one platform for all data, built so you can engage with insight in every moment. Trusted by industry leaders, SingleStore enables enterprises to adapt to change as it happens, embrace diverse data with ease, and accelerate the pace of innovation. SingleStore is venture-backed and headquartered in San Francisco with offices in Portland, Seattle, Boston, Bangalore, London, Lisbon, and Kyiv. Defining the future starts with The Database of Now™.

Consistent with our commitment to diversity & inclusion, we value individuals with the ability to work on diverse teams and with a diverse range of people.

To all recruitment agencies: SingleStore does not accept agency resumes. Please do not forward resumes to SingleStore employees. SingleStore is not responsible for any fees related to unsolicited resumes and will not pay fees to any third-party agency or company that does not have a signed agreement with the Company.

Backed by a renowned set of investors and partners including CapitalG, Tiger Global, and ICONIQ Growth, we’ve set out to build the future of AI.

Data visualization is often the most striking (and for some, the most accessible) part of the data-to-insights process. Let’s face it — there’s nothing more exciting than beautiful fit-for-purpose data viz.

We are looking for a talented software engineer to create usable, intuitive, beautiful interfaces and scalable engines for Dataiku DSS. Dataiku DSS brings together big data and AI technologies into a unique and easy-to-use platform. It allows data scientists to process data with SQL databases, Spark, and Kubernetes with either user-friendly interfaces or code. The same platform also allows business analysts to create powerful machines or deep learning models with just a few clicks.

What We Do

We design and code experiences that resonate with our growing customer base. We empower non-technical users with user-friendly and well-thought tools to let them quickly and efficiently visualize, analyze, or process their data. Our current technical stack is based on Javascript, AngularJS, Angular, and D3.js on the frontend (we only support the latest versions of Chrome and Firefox!). We develop using Java, Spring, and Python on the backend.

What You Will Do

Build the components that allow Dataiku DSS users to create and display charts, dashboards, and ad-hoc web applications in a scalable way (both frontend and backend).

Write high-quality code, as your teammates do!
You are the ideal recruit if:

Soy Víctor, cofundador de Planet 🌍, la única plataforma de automatización y gestión de precios para Shopify en español. Actualmente contamos con más de 500 clientes, con presencia en ¡+65 países diferentes!

Por ello, estamos ampliando nuestro equipo con un programador Front-end para el desarrollo de nuevas funcionalidades para nuestra plataforma. 💻🤙🏻

Qué ofrecemos:
Una oportunidad de escapar de los desarrollos monolíticos. Cada mes lanzamos una funcionalidad nueva, dando pie a progresar con tus conocimientos de desarrollo, y evitar la monotonía de hacer las mismas tareas una y otra vez.
Una organización horizontal donde se tienen en cuenta las diversas opiniones e ideas a la hora de tomar decisiones.
Un entorno de trabajo distendido al máximo. Nos consideramos una familia, y basamos nuestra cultura en la confianza y la cercanía 😊.
El mejor sitio para crecer. Avanzamos rápido, experimentando y aprendiendo juntos.
Horario flexible elegido por la persona. Trabajo por sprints, basado en metodología Scrum.
Salario: 23-27k€ anuales.

Qué puedes esperar de tus primeros meses en Planet:
El primer mes te pondrás a punto para poder desarrollar: aprenderás a usar nuestra plataforma y conocerás sus puntos fuertes y mejorables, prepararás tu entorno de desarrollo y aprenderás a usar las herramientas que tenemos en Front. Podrás ver cómo nos coordinamos e incluso haber colaborado en alguna tarea de desarrollo menor.
En el segundo mes habrás desplegado cambios menores en nuestro sistema de diseño y nuestras extensiones de Shopify con la ayuda de tu mentor.
En el tercer mes te habrás enfrentado a una tarea de desarrollo dentro de nuestra plataforma y para las extensiones de Shopify. Será un mes donde experimentarás a fondo con los stacks de cada entorno.
Al cabo de seis meses esperamos que ya sepas qué se puede y no se puede hacer con la API de Shopify, que participes en el diseño de nuevos addons y que puedas afrontar nuevos desarrollos en la plataforma (siempre con la ayuda de tus compañeros :)).
El objetivo final es que con el tiempo lideres el desarrollos de addons para la sección de automatizaciones, proponiendo soluciones que se adapten a los requisitos y limitaciones de Shopify.

Requisitos técnicos:
Conocimientos demostrables en el desarrollo con Angular o dos años de experiencia laboral en desarrollo web.
El prototipado se desarrolla en Figma y se maqueta en HTML5 y SCSS. Disponemos de una línea de diseño para simplificar este proceso.
Conocimientos básicos de patrones de diseño e interés por desarrollar código que sea fácil de mantener.
La mayor parte de los desarrollos parten de cero, por lo que priman las buenas prácticas. Esto permite ir actualizando las versiones sobre una base sólida y robusta para todo el equipo.
Experiencia con Git.
Conocimientos básicos de MongoDB.
MongoDB es nuestro motor de BBDD principal por lo que cualquier funcionalidad que desarrolles pasará por comunicarte con ella.
Para pruebas, debbuging e incidencias será necesario consultar directamente a la base de datos, por lo que, si tienes experiencia previa te resultará de gran ayuda.
No es necesario conocer todas las tecnologías de nuestro stack, pero sí especial interés por aprender y trabajar con ellas. En el día a día, desarrollarás en Angular@14, pero entrarás en contacto con nuestra infraestructura de AWS, sistema de logs y demás tecnologías.

También, es deseable:
Nos gustan las personas resolutivas, que no tengan miedo a enfrentarse a nuevas situaciones y a trabajar desde la terminal.
El interés por explorar todos los campos y tecnologías es algo esencial; siempre estamos buscando cómo optimizar nuestros procesos, aunque implique integrarnos con otras plataformas o usar otras librerías.
El inglés es algo esencial. Desarrollarás funcionalidad para una plataforma que se usa por todo el mundo; por lo que ayudar en la internacionalización de los textos y tener en cuenta el formateo de números y moneda es parte del día a día."

How do you know if you want to work at InnovationCast?

You seek to learn and want to grow personally and professionally. The real magic of innovation happens when committed people work smarter to turn ideas into new value. If we don’t become better at what we do, we won’t help our customers do the same. So if you value repetition more than discovery, this job is not for you.

You want to do work that matters for people who care. We’re a startup working to solve a big and relevant problem - one that won’t go away. Helping our customers to get better results through innovation management is - and will ever be - a work in progress. But it is so important and makes a difference for so many people, that the mission inspires you.

You welcome change and actually like to drive it. We strive to give our customers the best tools so they can keep making progress with innovation. This means that we have to experiment a lot with new ideas. As expected, some of them will work, others won’t. You need to be willing to be wrong, not afraid to make mistakes and actively learn from the process.

You don’t want to be micromanaged and want to bring actionable ideas to the team. Innovation is a team sport. Sometimes your work will seem tricky and confusing because you will be working on something that doesn’t exist yet. You will reflect on and understand our thinking and be humble to ask for help, and share difficulties and potential ways forward. But you don’t expect to be given a checklist. When you feel others may be wrong, you speak up and explain your point of view. You value honest communication.

You believe innovation and entrepreneurship can help companies change the way they work and how business is done. You may even want to become an entrepreneur. We’re set to use innovation management and entrepreneurship practices to provide software that helps companies think and act differently at scale. By opening innovation to employees, customers and partners, organizations can explore unforeseen possibilities and make real progress they couldn’t do on their own.

About InnovationCast

We’re a rapidly growing startup with an excellent SaaS product used by top brands globally. And we are on a mission to change the way organizations innovate: for better and for good. Want to join us?

InnovationCast is the collaborative innovation management software (SaaS) that helps organizations discover, incubate, and accelerate ideas. In short, we connect people and ideas and enable them to bring the best ideas to life and make a difference.

We have fantastic customers like DHL, Mayo Clinic, or Delta. We’re backed by Indico Capital, Shilling Capital and accelerated by Google for Startups.

We make innovation simpler, faster, more productive, and even fun. We believe that innovation and entrepreneurship mindsets and practices will become part of how people work daily. And we are set to make it possible and accessible for companies of all shapes and sizes.

Would you like to join a growing team and have an impact on the development of a world-class product? Do you want to work on a software used by thousands of people from top brands worldwide, which is used to innovate on new products, business models, and even social challenges? Then this job may be for you!"

We are currently scaling our business leveraging our technology, our team and our international culture.

Don't worry, we will share with you all the information you need to succeed!

What we can offer:

Our technical stack includes SQL, RedShift, and Metabase.

Remote working options. We are happy to welcome every new member into our state-of-the-art (literally!) office in Florence, however, we are also a modern and agile company, and are open to full or partial remote working where possible

No clocking in/out. We don’t believe in micromanaging and our working relationships are based on mutual trust, that’s why we don’t require our team to clock in and out of work. Of course, this trust relationship works both ways!

Work alongside an ambitious and supportive team. We are growing fast and no two days look the same at ShippyPro, but one thing never changes: your colleagues are always there to support you and to bounce off ideas!

Growth and learning opportunities. We believe that in order to grow as a company, our team also needs to continue learning and developing. Did you know that we have a growing Library in our office and you can borrow as many books as you like?

Meal pearks*: Whether you are working from home, from the office or from wherever you want, you can enjoy your meal voucher everyday. Getting hungry?

Free coffee policy. We are an international team, but our HQ is in Italy, hence we do take coffee breaks very seriously. Hot drinks are on us, and occasionally, Aperitivo too!

No dress code. That’s right, no formal attire is required when working in our HQ

only for Italian contract

We are a people-centric organization with one mission: “Make People Work Better”.

Hi, want to build out the future of content automation with us?

Storyteq is a Creative Marketing Operations Platform that empowers digital creative leads and marketing leaders, in top global brands and agencies to optimise and scale the way they create and manage digital creative assets. We believe creativity takes time, but creative production shouldn't.

Since 2016 our mission has been to revolutionise the way creative assets are created and managed throughout global organisations. Magic happens when we let technology empower creativity in this way.

Our endless curiosity and relentless commitment to our customers lies at the heart of our approach to solving problems. This common mission is weaved into our values: we take risks (be bold), thrive on change (move fast), and lead with trust (stay familiar).

About The Job

Are Experienced with modern JavaScript (ES5/ES6+)
Are great at modelling business domains into data models
Have a good understanding and experience with different database paradigms and when to use them
Have a deep understanding of APIs
You're proactive, result-driven, and excited to work in a fast-growing tech scale-up
You're a team player and like to work together to reach our goals
MUST HAVE gained Software Engineer / Development experience in a SaaS / Product based environment

Also great to have....

Experience with Node frameworks like NestJS or Express
Experience with message queues like RabbitMQ, PubSub or similar

Our customers are at the forefront of some of the most interesting data in the world, using SingleStore to push the boundaries every day. To do this well, they leverage the expertise of our Support Engineering Team, composed of technical subject matter experts on the frontlines of critical customer issues.

This Support Engineering role skews far more towards engineering than typical technical support as you will need to delve into database internals and memory allocators, diagnose complex SQL query behavior, and investigate Linux and Kubernetes related configurations, all in the name of resolving complex product issues. Our Support Engineers are constantly learning a wide range of customer systems and technical concepts and are thrilled by the new and exciting challenges that they encounter each day.

To accurately identify the source and solution of an issue, this team will take the time to learn about the customer’s business and systems while helping to improve their fundamental SingleStore and database operational knowledge. This often requires additional research and time spent on learning new technologies and tools outside of just the database engine while also being deeply engaged with multiple departments including development teams, query performance engineering, product management, infrastructure SREs, etc.

Role And Responsibilities

Provide product support to our on-premise and cloud hosted enterprise customers, acting as the first-line-of-defense for complex technical issues, bug diagnosis, or resolving critical outages.
Identify and reproduce product issues and submit formal bug reports or feature requests to the appropriate Engineering team.
Understand and help to improve complex SQL behavior to diagnose bugs or improve performance.
Collaborate with software developers, sales engineers, and technical account managers to keep all teams up to date with current issues a customer may be facing.
Work to streamline and improve various Support and Engineering processes and tools, author new knowledge base articles and run-books, and help the team continually improve efficiency and effectiveness.
Participate in our on-call rotation that may include weekends and holidays.

Required Skills And Experience

4+ years of previous customer-facing advanced technical support experience.
Previous experience as a DBA or Support Engineer at a database company.
Experience with SQL databases and advanced SQL query optimization and tuning. You should be familiar enough with at least one commercial or open source database to decipher its EXPLAIN plan and understand potential performance impact or ways to improve the query.
Strong background in general product troubleshooting, keeping in mind that query processing issues can be impacted by database or linux configuration and resource availability.
A solid linux performance background. That means you are hands-on with Linux and your skills include generating and reading flame graphs, checking system resource utilization, and parsing verbose log files. Bonus points for familiarity with Kubernetes.
Experience with a scripting or coding language. Whether it’s C++, Python, Go, or Bash, you should have a go-to solution for quick problem-solving and be able to navigate through our extensive code base.
Familiarity with distributed systems and AWS/GCP. You understand how organizations deploy and maintain distributed applications and services across multiple machines and know how to analyze these systems for performance bottlenecks.
Experience improving support processes regarding ticket triage, escalation, and reporting business metrics back to the organization.
Strong written and verbal English communication skills. Have the ability to explain technical concepts to a wide range of end-users.

SingleStore is one platform for all data, built so you can engage with insight in every moment. Trusted by industry leaders, SingleStore enables enterprises to adapt to change as it happens, embrace diverse data with ease, and accelerate the pace of innovation. SingleStore is venture-backed and headquartered in San Francisco with offices in Portland, Seattle, Boston, Bangalore, London, Lisbon, and Kyiv. Defining the future starts with The Database of Now™.

Consistent with our commitment to diversity & inclusion, we value individuals with the ability to work on diverse teams and with a diverse range of people.

Passion for automating tasks and processes
Strong English language skills and ability to work independently, as an effective part of a globally distributed team

Additionally, we'd love it if you have:
