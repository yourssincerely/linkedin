What you SHOULD KNOW about VaynerMedia
Think “lab” and not “agency”. We get excited about solving business problems, not creating advertising for the sake of making advertising. Our entrepreneurship DNA runs deep. We’re willing to break rules, try new things, and test hypotheses if it means better understanding our craft. It’s fun!
We believe 100% that brands can be built on digital platforms and part of our model is built bottom up, flipping the traditional advertising model and process on its head. We don’t play to agency/industry norms and our culture and energy reflects that.
Our environment (and pace) feels much more like a start-up than most agencies you might be used to. Hopefully that, and the opportunity to collaborate with the talented and enthusiastic crew, work with big brands excites you, as it does us. We can’t wait to meet you.

You will have a key role in advising, assisting, informing, training and alerting all employees (especially developers). You will also be responsible for the day-to-day management of technical operations in the context of ISO 27001 certification. The technical security team is involved from the identification/detection of a security issue to its resolution (development and implementation of the security patches).

You need to be able to share your ideas and thoughts well in spoken and written English and to understand what is being said. If you need help with this, we can provide you with a Busuu subscription to improve your English immediately.
 You ideally have the following skills/experience:
 Able to perform offensive security assessments on an infrastructure or an application

 You are able to popularize technical terms to facilitate the adoption of security measures within projects or to broadcast messages to Pennylaners

About the Project
Our client is looking for QA Networking Engineers with Test Automation and Python skillset, who are defining and maintaining the Quality Release Gate for our Customer. This Team has the ownership to define the process, debug all aspects of the Products' functionality in its release cycle and work closely together with our Test and Framework Development Team to identify root causes, raise issues accordingly to feature developers, triage problems and fix the issues inside their area of competence (the Product Testing Framework). This team also collaborates closely with the Customer's Developer Team on feature issues and thus reduces the number of flaws in the Product. The Customer relies on us to keep a healthy and real PASS rate of the tests in order to maintain a high-performance product and demonstrable quality metrics (Quality Gate). The previous in-place process was not scaling up to the agile release strategy of the Customer's products.

Thus, the ideal candidate has deep knowledge of computer networking, as well as automation skills necessary to understand and debug efficiently the various testing scenarios (strong preference is Python, as the framework and tests are written in Python).

Work in a Docker environment. Define the Quality Gate process with the help of our existing team, maintaining it and having ownership over it. Collaborate closely with our local team and with the Customer's team. Contribute to automated test case development and framework development when the QG is GREEN and/or workload need is low (e.g. between release-end - release-start) - to keep a flexible, challenging work content and thus keep people motivation levels high, as well as work efficiency.

Our Team has developed a state-of-the-art Auto Triage Framework, which uses advanced signature learning techniques to assist our Engineers in performing RCA and streamlining the Quality Gate process. Everyone has the opportunity to use and contribute to Auto Triage, a unique framework which is providing exceptional value to our Engineers and to our Customer.

It offers a suite of products that drive true personalization and digital commerce growth, including: 
Discovery, offering AI-driven search and merchandising 
Content, offering a headless CMS 
Engagement, offering a leading CDP and marketing automation solutions 
Together, these solutions combine the power of unified customer and product data with the speed and scale of AI optimization, enabling revenue-driving digital commerce experiences that convert on any channel and every journey. Bloomreach serves over 850 global brands including Albertsons, Bosch, Puma, FC Bayern München, and Marks & Spencer. Bloomreach recently raised $175 million in a Series F funding round, bringing its total valuation to $2.2 billion. The investment was led by Goldman Sachs Asset Management with participation from Bain Capital Ventures and Sixth Street Growth. For more information, visit Bloomreach.com. We are currently expanding our Application Platform team and we are looking for Backend Software Engineer. Is ""security"", ""curiosity"" or ""growth"" your middle name? Then you are a good fit and you can be one of us. You can work remotely or from one of our local offices. The salary starts at €3,000 based on your experience level. About your role and the team: The Application Platform team empowers other engineering teams to build their services effectively and with security and compliance built-in by designing, implementing, and maintaining the magic solid foundations and the core frameworks of the Bloomreach Engagement. Examples of the initiatives driven by this team are: 
Integrated zero-trust authentication and authorization management system.
Platform for collecting and processing audit logs in a distributed environment.
Notification center, which allows other teams to communicate information to customers through a single unified channel (upcoming project). 
What you might like about this role: 
Wide reach - we deal with teams across the company - product, security, architects, engineers, even customers.
Security perspective will be a key element of your day-to-day work
Developing Cloud Native services consumed by customers as well as other engineering teams 
What your typical day might look like: You start your day with a code review of your colleague’s tasks while sipping a cup of fresh-brewed tea or coffee, looking for any signs of problems and possible optimizations. Then you join your teammates on a quick daily standup, where you discuss what you’re currently working on and the plan for the next few days. After the meeting, you get into “the zone” and spend a few undisturbed hours working on the new authentication framework while making sure it’s safely covered by a suite of unit tests. With a few clicks you quickly spin up a brand new instance of the system in the development cluster, deploy your change and notify the frontend engineer that it’s ready. You grab a snack and take a little break from coding. Instead, you help a fellow backend engineer from another team figure out the best way to integrate their new service with the audit logging platform. In the meantime the frontend engineer gets back to you and confirms that all the new endpoints work as expected, so you create a merge request and ask your teammates for a code review. It’s a complex piece of code, so you go through it together. After your code is approved, you merge it, automatically deploying it to the staging environment where it receives further testing by the QA team and automated integration tests before being released to production. You end your day in a short meeting with a product manager and the director of engineering, where you flesh out the idea you had over lunch yesterday for a new approach to release management that would make the whole process even faster. Our tech stack: 
Python & Go
MongoDB, Redis, Apache Kafka
Kubernetes (GKE)
Various Google Cloud Platform services (Pub/Sub, BigTable, DataFlow, ...)
Gitlab CI/CD, Prometheus and Grafana 
What we expect of the candidate: The ideal candidate has: 
At least 3 year experience developing in Python or Golang
Designing and implementing production-grade REST APIs 
Having experience with operating services in production is beneficial
A working understanding of fundamental web security principles (OWASP), Authentication and Authorization practices
Experience with database systems of different kinds (MongoDB, Redis, Apache Kafka)

Monthly lunch entitlement by up to 110€ per month

În 2020, am ajuns pe lista Deloitte Fast 500 EMEA a companiilor cu cea mai rapidă creștere, iar în 2022 am primit pentru a treia oară premiul „Lovable Workplace”.
Astăzi, peste 2000 de companii folosesc zilnic produsul nostru, iar echipa noastră este formată din peste 90 de membri. Misiunea noastră este să facem produse inovatoare, bine concepute, care să permită companiilor să deservească mai mulți clienți. Valorile noastre de bază sunt următoarele: îmbunătățirea constantă, onestitate, deschiderea, conștientizarea de sine, corectitudinea.
 Ești focusat pe atingerea obiectivelor de vânzări și cauți constant modalități de a fi și mai eficient? Continuă-ți cariera alături de o echipă motivată!
 Avem o poziție pentru tine dacă te poți identifica cu următoarele:
Comunici bine? Îți place să gestionezi conversațiile?
Ai deja experiență de minim 1 an în vânzări și ești interesat de dezvoltare în acest domeniu?
Ai dori să discuți cu directorii de afaceri, antreprenori și să le afli problemele și nevoile de afaceri?
Gestionezi calculatorul la nivel avansat? Nu ai probleme în a lucra cu Google Office Apps? Ți-ar plăcea să înveți și tu să lucrezi în MiniCRM?
Îți place să vânezi recorduri și ești mânat de spiritul competiției? Nu interpretezi recordurile stabilite ca o limitare, ci ca rezultate care trebuie obținute?
Ești mânat de numere? Ești concentrat pe atingerea obiectivelor tale de vânzări și cauți constant modalități de a fi și mai eficient?
Ești persistent și orientat către rezultate? Nu renunți la primul obstacol și poți lucra pe cont propriu pentru a-ți atinge scopul?
Ești perseverent și plin de resurse? Rezultatele și dorința de cunoaștere te conduc?
Ai o atitudine pozitivă și ai încredere în tine? O persoană care crede în sine, în abilitățile sale și în produsul pe care îl reprezintă? Asta nu este o problemă, nu-i așa?
Ai cunoștințe de limba engleză la nivel mediu spre avansat! (Pentru comunicarea cu clienții se utilizează limba română, însă pentru comunicarea în cadrul companiei folosim și limba engleză)
  Care vor fi sarcinile tale? 
Ca și parte a procesului de Onboarding vei avea posibilitatea să cunoști în întregime procesul nostru de vânzări, vei face cunoștință și cu colegii din echipa de Asistent vânzări/Sales Support, unde vei vedea cum:
Contactăm telefonic clienții interesați (manageri de companii, antreprenori) pentru evaluarea nevoilor acestora.
Concluzionăm pe baza discuției avute dacă soluția noastră poate să le rezolve problemele, nevoile, și să eficientizeze procesele lor.
Programăm mai departe la o ședință de consultanță cu un coleg din echipa de Vânzări.
Gestionăm atât leadurile cât și sarcinile zilnice într-un sistem unificat și accesibil de CRM, care ne ajută și să ne monitorizăm progresul zilnic.
Colaborăm cu alte echipe, în special cu echipa de Vânzări, căreia colegii le oferă suport și cu care se sincronizează legat de targete.
  După care, focusul tău va fi pe partea de Vânzări, unde vei:
Fii busola procesului nostru de vânzări, vei ajuta managerii de afaceri de succes, antreprenorii, să ia o decizie responsabilă cu privire la implementarea MiniCRM.
Identifica nevoile și provocările de afaceri, prin utilizarea diverselor metodologii și tehnici de chestionare.
Oferi consultanță înainte de vânzare. În urma descoperirii problemelor și nevoilor de afaceri, vei folosi partajarea online a ecranului pentru a prezenta soluția în MiniCRM care va ajuta clienții să devină mai productivi, de succes și remarcabili pe piață.
Face partea de administrare. Coșmarul oricărui vânzător. Vești bune însă: nu vei folosi o grămadă de hârtii sau post-it-uri, nici foi Excel. Folosim o soluție unică și ușor de accesat de gestionare a relațiilor cu clienții care se numește MiniCRM. :)
Colabora eficient cu alte echipe. Vânzările joacă un rol central în organizație, deci sunt strâns legate de mai multe echipe. De aceea, va fi extrem de important să avem o relație bună cu echipa de Account Management (căreia îi transferăm clienții importanți pentru a ajuta la implementarea sistemului), echipa de Sales Support (care ne califică mai întâi clienții și îi transmit spre vânzare) și echipa de Marketing (care se așteaptă ca feedback-ul nostru valoros să fie încorporat în reclamele și campaniile noastre).
Contribui prin rezultatele tale la îndeplinirea obiectivelor de echipă.
  Ce îți oferim?
Venit mediu lunar: 7150 - 8200 RON brut/lună, compus din: parte fixă+ bonusuri lunare bazate pe performanță (comisionul nu este plafonat, așa că poți câștiga mai mult decât intervalul menționat mai sus, încă din perioada de probă!)
Asigurare de sănătate privată
Onboarding complet și oportunități de formare
Zile suplimentare de vacanță în funcție de politica noastră internă
Dispozitive de calitate (Macbook, smartphone)
Oportunitate de a lucra de acasă

  La ce te poți aștepta de la MiniCRM?
Succesul nu este o chestiune de noroc, așa că acordăm o atenție deosebită dezvoltării profesionale și personale.
Recunoaștem și sărbătorim rezultatele și performanța remarcabilă. Pentru acestea deschidem deseori și șampania. ;)
Ne pasă de părerea ta. Apreciem ideile și inițiativele, iar echipa noastră de resurse umane se ocupă de feedback-ul colegilor săptămânal de săptămână. Ne vom ocupa și de feedback-ul tău.
Acordăm atenție echilibrului dintre viața profesională și viața privată, suntem flexibili dacă ai o sarcină administrativă importantă, și nu există niciun dezavantaj dacă ai copii.
Dacă ai un cățeluș, îl poți aduce cu tine la birou în fiecare zi, dacă nu ai, îl poți mângâia pe cel al colegului :)

To do this well, they leverage the expertise of our Support Engineering Team, composed of technical subject matter experts on the frontlines of critical customer issues.
 This Support Engineering role skews far more towards engineering than typical technical support as you will need to delve into database internals and memory allocators, diagnose complex SQL query behavior, and investigate Linux and Kubernetes related configurations, all in the name of resolving complex product issues. Our Support Engineers are constantly learning a wide range of customer systems and technical concepts and are thrilled by the new and exciting challenges that they encounter each day.
 To accurately identify the source and solution of an issue, this team will take the time to learn about the customer’s business and systems while helping to improve their fundamental SingleStore and database operational knowledge. This often requires additional research and time spent on learning new technologies and tools outside of just the database engine while also being deeply engaged with multiple departments including development teams, query performance engineering, product management, infrastructure SREs, etc.
   Provide product support to our on-premise and cloud hosted enterprise customers, acting as the first-line-of-defense for complex technical issues, bug diagnosis, or resolving critical outages.
Identify and reproduce product issues and submit formal bug reports or feature requests to the appropriate Engineering team.
Understand and help to improve complex SQL behavior to diagnose bugs or improve performance.
Collaborate with software developers, sales engineers, and technical account managers to keep all teams up to date with current issues a customer may be facing.
Work to streamline and improve various Support and Engineering processes and tools, author new knowledge base articles and run-books, and help the team continually improve efficiency and effectiveness.
Participate in our on-call rotation that may include weekends and holidays.
   4+ years of previous customer-facing advanced technical support experience.
Previous experience as a DBA or Support Engineer at a database company.
Experience with SQL databases and advanced SQL query optimization and tuning. You should be familiar enough with at least one commercial or open source database to decipher its EXPLAIN plan and understand potential performance impact or ways to improve the query.
Strong background in general product troubleshooting, keeping in mind that query processing issues can be impacted by database or linux configuration and resource availability.
A solid linux performance background. That means you are hands-on with Linux and your skills include generating and reading flame graphs, checking system resource utilization, and parsing verbose log files. Bonus points for familiarity with Kubernetes.
Experience with a scripting or coding language. Whether it’s C++, Python, Go, or Bash, you should have a go-to solution for quick problem-solving and be able to navigate through our extensive code base.
Familiarity with distributed systems and AWS/GCP. You understand how organizations deploy and maintain distributed applications and services across multiple machines and know how to analyze these systems for performance bottlenecks.
Experience improving support processes regarding ticket triage, escalation, and reporting business metrics back to the organization.
Strong written and verbal English communication skills. Have the ability to explain technical concepts to a wide range of end-users. 
 SingleStore is one platform for all data, built so you can engage with insight in every moment. Trusted by industry leaders, SingleStore enables enterprises to adapt to change as it happens, embrace diverse data with ease, and accelerate the pace of innovation. SingleStore is venture-backed and headquartered in San Francisco with offices in Portland, Seattle, Boston, Bangalore, London, Lisbon, and Kyiv. Defining the future starts with The Database of Now™.
 Consistent with our commitment to diversity & inclusion, we value individuals with the ability to work on diverse teams and with a diverse range of people.

The investment was led by Goldman Sachs Asset Management with participation from Bain Capital Ventures and Sixth Street Growth. For more information, visit Bloomreach.com. We are currently expanding our Application Platform team and we are looking for Backend Software Engineer. Is ""security"", ""curiosity"" or ""growth"" your middle name? Then you are a good fit and you can be one of us. You can work remotely or from one of our local offices. The salary starts at €3,000 based on your experience level. About your role and the team: The Application Platform team empowers other engineering teams to build their services effectively and with security and compliance built-in by designing, implementing, and maintaining the magic solid foundations and the core frameworks of the Bloomreach Engagement. Examples of the initiatives driven by this team are: 
Integrated zero-trust authentication and authorization management system.
Platform for collecting and processing audit logs in a distributed environment.
Notification center, which allows other teams to communicate information to customers through a single unified channel (upcoming project). 
What you might like about this role: 
Wide reach - we deal with teams across the company - product, security, architects, engineers, even customers.
Security perspective will be a key element of your day-to-day work
Developing Cloud Native services consumed by customers as well as other engineering teams 
What your typical day might look like: You start your day with a code review of your colleague’s tasks while sipping a cup of fresh-brewed tea or coffee, looking for any signs of problems and possible optimizations. Then you join your teammates on a quick daily standup, where you discuss what you’re currently working on and the plan for the next few days. After the meeting, you get into “the zone” and spend a few undisturbed hours working on the new authentication framework while making sure it’s safely covered by a suite of unit tests. With a few clicks you quickly spin up a brand new instance of the system in the development cluster, deploy your change and notify the frontend engineer that it’s ready. You grab a snack and take a little break from coding. Instead, you help a fellow backend engineer from another team figure out the best way to integrate their new service with the audit logging platform. In the meantime the frontend engineer gets back to you and confirms that all the new endpoints work as expected, so you create a merge request and ask your teammates for a code review. It’s a complex piece of code, so you go through it together. After your code is approved, you merge it, automatically deploying it to the staging environment where it receives further testing by the QA team and automated integration tests before being released to production. You end your day in a short meeting with a product manager and the director of engineering, where you flesh out the idea you had over lunch yesterday for a new approach to release management that would make the whole process even faster. Our tech stack: 
Python & Go
MongoDB, Redis, Apache Kafka
Kubernetes (GKE)
Various Google Cloud Platform services (Pub/Sub, BigTable, DataFlow, ...)
Gitlab CI/CD, Prometheus and Grafana 
What we expect of the candidate: The ideal candidate has: 
At least 3 year experience developing in Python or Golang
Designing and implementing production-grade REST APIs 
Having experience with operating services in production is beneficial
A working understanding of fundamental web security principles (OWASP), Authentication and Authorization practices
Experience with database systems of different kinds (MongoDB, Redis, Apache Kafka) 
Regional benefits: 
Monthly lunch entitlement by up to 110€ per month
Pension scheme or Health insurance depending on region 
More things you'll like about Bloomreach: Culture: 
A great deal of freedom and trust. At Bloomreach we don’t clock in and out, and we have neither corporate rules nor long approval processes. This freedom goes hand in hand with responsibility. We are interested in results from day one.

We are a forward-looking company with a desire to remain both innovative and sustainable in an increasingly global market. We are looking for highly motivated, emotionally intelligent, hardworking, articulate communicators like you to help us achieve our growth aspirations.
 This role will be based on site at our Neuville-aux-Bois Packaging Plant. 
 We are the leading provider of packaging solutions and Europe’s biggest recycler. We have a unique supply cycle strategy with an industry leading approach to sustainability: we want the brightest new ideas to continually improve our design, innovation and entrepreneurship. That’s where you come in; every role at DS Smith plays a part in helping us reduce that carbon footprint.
  About the programme
Our scheme runs for two years and will give graduates the foundations to succeed in either Supply Chain disciplines, with different placements across the course of the programme. You’ll go on a rigorous development programme to give you the skillsets to succeed in these areas, whilst also developing you into becoming a DS Smith future leader. You’ll be paired up with a mentor and be given first class training from our external partner to develop leadership capabilities and be offered opportunities to put everything you’ve learned into practice.
 Our Supply Chain graduates will ensure we have the right materials in the right place, at the right time, at the right price, linking our sales team to our operational team to maximise use of stock and avoid waste, ensuring everything we do is cost effective and efficient.
 You’ll work in different locations for each part of your placement, therefore full mobility in terms of location will be required to be considered for this role (in some cases this may be a change in country), but don’t worry, we’ll support you with any moving costs.
 Alongside the role specific skills you’ll develop, you’ll be in a cohort of graduates and together we’ll offer you a world class development programme which will support you in becoming one of our future leaders.
  In year one the focus is on understanding yourself; your skills, your strengths and how to realise your potential.
In year two your development will be about understanding others, how to work effectively in teams and how to support others.
 You’ll then be in charge of your own career pathway, whether you grow into a leadership role or a specialism.
  About you
To be considered for this scheme you must have as a minimum:
A degree within Supply Chain (or due to achieve your qualification before September 2023).
Speak fluently in English and French (minimum B2 level).
Hold the relevant right to work within the country you’re applying within.

Solve low-stake bug tickets or quick wins
Commit early and often thanks to our cloud dev environment (Gitpod every day all day)
Be fully integrated in the team’s rituals from day 1 
A Mid engineer at factorial participates in requirements definition with the PM, and is autonomous to deliver a solution that matches those. You also take ownership of small initiatives, and are interested in the outcome, not just the output. You participate in the team’s decision: technical through Requests For Comments that you write yourself or read others, or business giving your feedback on OKRs & priorities for the quarter. After that, you will join in the team's initiatives: from definition in collaboration with the team’s PM (by commenting on your teammates RFCs at first, and then proposing your own), to deployment to production and communication. You will be a product engineer, taking ownership of small initiatives, and being interested in the outcome, not just the output. About the outcome, you’ll also be a part of the conversation when the team defined their quarterly OKRs and priorities. You will review code daily and get feedback on your own code at every pull request, from all team members, including juniors.
