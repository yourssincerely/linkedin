About Us:

Consensus is a top place to work due to the incredible culture our employees have created. We strive to provide an opportunity to work with a great team with a compelling product with the objective that adding value in your work life fuels the rest of your life. We know that a winning company is built on the efforts of its people, and that’s an environment we foster at Consensus. We encourage every employee to bring their authentic self to work and take ownership of their position and their career. We strive to give our employees everything they need to make meaningful contributions to the overall success of our company. We’re looking for go-getters that are excited to thrive in a company going through an exciting growth phase!

We are a fast-growing SaaS company based in the United States. We are changing the way the world buys enterprise software. We do this by providing intelligent demo automation software that helps you scale Presales. How does this work?

We believe buying enterprise software should be simple, pleasant, and fast instead of complex, painful, and slow (which is how it is today). Buyers now want instant access to presales (sales engineering) resources throughout the buying experience but they find it harder and harder to get what they need. Using Consensus, a sales engineering team builds a library of reusable interactive video demos that Sales sends out on-demand. Consensus automatically personalizes the experience and tracks engagement as the prospect shares the demo with other stakeholders in the buying group, bringing the entire buying group to live demos better educated and ready to talk specifics.

This not only reduces unqualified demos to near zero and can double the presales team’s productivity, it also removes the ""demo lag time"" for prospects and shortens the sales cycle by as much as 68%.

Our Values:

Our values are extremely important to us and we hope that they mean something to you too. We want everyone to bring their authentic selves to work every day. We hope you can help us continue to grow without having to be perfect, but willing to put your name on something knowing it is a “version one”. Everyone here takes total ownership and accountability, because owning our outcomes means making a real contribution. We also believe in a “no peacemongering” principle. We know our path to success is hard and we don’t hesitate to ask hard things of others. We are respectfully confrontational to one another and ask direct accountability questions.

Why joining Smartcat might be your best move so far
The ongoing rise of the content economy is causing a massive shift in the language industry. All today's megatrends AI in the language space, gateway marketplaces in B2B, etc. — are converging at lightning speed. Smartcat's disruptive business model taps into this $50B industry with a platform where buyers and suppliers connect, collaborate, and leverage our workflow SaaS.
You will enjoy building with us. You will drive changes in how an old-fashioned global language industry operates while improving how hundreds of thousands of people work and millions of people exchange knowledge and ideas worldwide.
While the language industry is big and fragmented enough to keep us busy building a billion-dollar company in the next few years, we are already seeing how the platform naturally expands to adjacent language and content-related verticals, expanding our TAM and making our journey even more exciting.
We are a global team of 150+ enthusiastic people. We have been fully remote since 2020, with some locations populated with more ""Smartcatters"" than others, such as Boston, NYC, SF, the Bay Area, London, Lisbon, and Yerevan. We strive to grow aggressively, but we also preserve our high performance, engagement, and open feedback culture. As diverse as we are, we love working and having fun together, and we're sure you'll love working with us too.
Smartcat is backed by Matrix Partners, FJ Labs, and other top VC firms focusing on SaaS and marketplace startups (you might recognize names like HubSpot, Zendesk, Uber, Stripe, RigUp, and Quora in their portfolios). This helps us innovate at a fast pace and learn from top professionals in other industries.
We are looking for someone who will become a part of the team and play a critical role in the most exciting part of our journey from a post-Series B startup to a company exceeding $1b in GMV and valuation. Our journey isn't for the faint of heart. You need to be an extremely fast learner to bring value to our users and the industry as a whole. You need to see the big picture and execute strategies that significantly increase shareholder value over time. We need a sharp mind who can stay two steps ahead on the road. We've got lots of success to share if you're ready for it."

Vero is a multi-channel messaging platform built for the modern data stack. Modern marketing and product teams all over the world use Vero to automate communications with hundreds of millions of end-users.

With nearly a decade's experience in this space Vero is undergoing a transformation that is putting it on an exciting new trajectory. We've recently launched a new take on our product: a version that sits directly on top of customers' data platforms like Redshift, Google BigQuery, Snowflake and more. This is a massive shift that gives teams easier access to their data, faster and for less cost.

Vero is looking for a Site Reliability/Platform Engineer to join us on our journey and to help us build the future of messaging automation.

As a company, Vero works hard to ensure a friendly and empathetic working environment. We aim for as little politics and ego as possible, we believe in inclusivity and work to understand and support each other at every turn. We're proud of our culture and if these values sound on point to you, we'd love to hear from you!

About the role
We’re looking for a senior platform engineer to architect, develop and manage our infrastructure. Along with the other members of our platform team you will be responsible for the reliability, security and scalability of our infrastructure.

You will have strong practical experience with AWS, Docker and Terraform. You have real world experience with real-time, event-driven data pipelines and technologies such as Kafka. You have experience in scaling SQL-based data stores such as PostgreSQL (Amazon RDS, Aurora).

You will be on call as part of our platform team rotation. We have platform team members in the USA and in Australia and your rotation will generally be during standard daylight working hours CET. You will be on call during weekends (and your compensation will reflect this).

Vero believes in sustainable growth. Our default posture is not ""billion dollars or bust"". As a result, we are a small team that deliver big things. You need to be a “manager of one” to succeed in this role.

Responsibilities
Implement changes that improve the stability and reliability of our existing platform. Think ahead and build for the future as opposed to bandaid fixes for today. We aim to balance “getting things done” with work that improves our velocity and long-term outcomes.
Build robust, easy-to-use foundational platforms and tools that enable engineering teams to provision services rapidly, consistently, and securely.
Develop tools and applications that use clean, efficient code, ensuring code quality and standards.
Be part of our on-call rotation, owning the EU hours 9am-5pm CET, and respond to operational incidents during on-call hours.

About you
Does this sound like you?
You are interested in building for the long-term, have a strong problem-solving ability and the aptitude to consider the big picture when solving engineering challenges.
You have a passion for building high quality web application experiences.
You strive for elegant solutions that are as simple and effective as possible.
You have an interest in and respect for both the latest technologies available on cloud providers, as well as traditional solutions.
You have excellent communication skills and a willingness to collaborate on ideas.

Requirements
Must-haves:
Experience and strong interest in databases and data storage (PostgreSQL, Redshift), key-value stores, messaging, and distributed systems.
Experience delivering projects at scale and making sound engineering choices to set us up for future growth and success.
Analytical mind with problem-solving aptitude.
A strong fundamental understanding of backend components such as databases, web protocols and networking.
Coding/scripting knowledge in Bash, Ruby, Python, Java or a C-based language.
Ability to work independently.
Experience working in remote teams.
Nice-to-haves:
Experience with Go or Rust.
BSc/BA in Computer Science or a related degree.
Contributions to major open source projects.

Benefits
Competitive salary. We pay in the top quartile, based on Sydney (AU) salary data wherever you are located. Sydney has a similar cost of living to cities like Tel Aviv, Austin, Portland, Oslo and more: making it very competitive. We pay everyone the same, regardless of geography.
Flexible work. Work in the way that produces your best results. Many of our team members work from home one day a week, others come to the office every day and many are completely remote. We’re committed to helping you feel like you can be the happiest and most productive you.
Yearly team conference. We host an annual team conference to get together as a team, challenge the status-quo and expand our vision for the future.
Parental leave. We offer a generous parental leave policy.

Vero is an equal opportunity employer. We are a participant in programs like Project F's Program 50/50 and are endorsed by Australia's Work180. These programs help us identify underlying systemic and environmental issues that are known to derail women in careers in technology so that we can address them head on and create a truly equal workplace."

Why will you enjoy this new opportunity?

We provide and operate hundreds of managed databases instances for critical teams in VMware and a growing number of other customers. Most of those database servers are PostgreSQL which is not surprising since it is the most popular database in the World. Over time, we will encounter every possible performance, scalability, and reliability challenge that a PostgreSQL operator may face.

As a Database Engineer or administrator, you will design how to solve those challenges. That will help you grow to be a world-class expert on PostgreSQL and similar relational databases. You will join a motivated team with solid expertise in software development and you will deliver together with us the next groundbreaking database-as-a-service product.

Success in the Role: What are the performance outcomes over the first 6-12 months you will work toward completing?

In 12 months, you will apply your existing experience in operating PostgreSQL to define how we configure and deploy the database, including:

Deployment topology and replication configuration for high availability. Selection and configuration for off-site, incremental and schedules backups. Adapting the configuration of PostgreSQL to different types of workloads.

In all cases, you will work with the rest of the team to automate the application of those designs and monitor how they impact the performance of customer databases.

What type of work will I be doing? What assignments will I be performing on a regular basis?

Typical assignments for your position will be:

Research how to configure and deploy PostgreSQL, and in the future other databases, to achieve the outcomes above.
Automate in your tool of choice – Terraform, Ansible, Kubernetes Controllers (Golang) – applying that configuration.
Define metrics for each outcome and test configuration changes at scale. Troubleshoot database issues that occur in our test environment or in the deployments of our customers.
Adapt your design accordingly.

Who is the hiring manager? What is the structure of the team/organization I will be working with?

You’ll be joining a growing team of engineers located in Bulgaria, Ireland, India and the US. The larger team is split into several sub-teams with local management, focused on the different areas of the platform.

We are looking for individuals who are self-driven and have the passion to learn new skills and solve complex technical issues. The leadership for this role believes in creating a pleasant and inclusive workplace and building strong relationships and collaboration within the team.

Where is this role located?

The location of this role is flexible within Bulgaria. Work will be done from an office some days during the week and other days from a non-VMware building with the employees having the option to choose the option of working fully remote.

At voize we develop an app that allows professionals like healthcare workers and inspection engineers to fill out forms via domain-specific speech recognition. Healthcare workers speak freely and our AI automatically generates the correct structured forms.

We are YC-funded and grow quickly. Our customers like Caritas, Contilia, and TÜV NORD create thousands of documentation records every single day.

Today speech recognition is primarily used as a “fun” gimmick for consumers, who set kitchen timers with their Alexa speaker. We build a completely new class of speech-powered applications, to supercharge the professional workforce. By focusing on individual workflows like healthcare or vehicle inspections, we create truly magical user experiences and save each user 30 minutes per day in administrative work. Don’t believe it? See for yourself in our 3-minute product demo (https://youtu.be/AlkVD4OwCQk).

The entire system is built in-house, giving us full control over the user experience, product design, NLP models, and speech recognition. Our custom speech recognition models already outperform Google with 10x lower error rates and we are just getting started!

If you ever wanted to work at the bleeding edge of product design, applied machine learning research, and MLOps, you should apply. You get to build products with daily user feedback, train AI models on real-world data, and ship to production on a daily basis.

At voize new software is deployed to production every 5h on average! We deploy new AI models every 24h and have one of the largest speech data sets for medical documentation.

Tasks

We’re looking for team members who enjoy talking to customers, iterating & shipping quickly.

As an App developer, you will take core responsibility for the product development and technical execution of our React Native App. You will work closely with the founders, talk regularly to customers and design new features. You get to take ownership over the whole development cycle, from feature ideation to technical execution, to analytics review and hearing user feedback.

Requirements

You should be comfortable with the following tech stack
React Native & Typescript
Kotlin & Kotlin Multiplatform
Android & iOS Native App Development
Typical Software Engineering skills like Git, Docker, etc.

Team Work & Personal Skills:
You have to be able to work in a team, communicate clearly, take ownership over your work and share feedback with your teammates.
You need to feel empathy for the user and have a deep passion for great product experiences. You will talk to users, listen to their feedback, understand their daily challenges, and translate those insights into product decisions.
You need great time management skills and be self-sufficient. Your colleges have to be able to rely on you.

Language & Region
You need to be able to speak German fluently. (especially to talk to customers)
You need to live in Germany and be legally allowed to work in Germany.

Benefits
voize is based in Berlin and has a remote-friendly workplace.
We offer flexible work hours and believe that you know best when you want to work
We have an open culture and regular team events
As a fast-growing startup, there are new challenges daily and plenty of learning opportunities for your personal development
Own part of the company through stock option packages

Interview Process

To help us determine that we are both a great fit for each other and are happy to change the world together for years to come, we run a 4 stage interview process. This process is usually completed in 2-3 weeks.
First Call with the founder (Remote):

This is a more informal video call with you and one of our founders, to get to know you, and share more details on the role. Together we want to determine if this role is a great fit for you and get a basic understanding of your personal interests and technical & soft skills.
Technical Interview with CTO (Remote):

In this video call, we want to learn more about your technical skills and past projects you have worked on.

The best way to impress us is by showing us a project you’ve built and walking us through the 2 hardest technical/design decisions you had to make.

Mostly, we want to know that you can code and ship fairly involved systems, and speak to them with clarity on the details. This tends to be a good indication that an engineer had strong ownership and showed autonomy in making a product or technical decisions.
Pair Programming Challenge (Remote):

At this stage, we want to show you the kind of challenges we are facing on a daily basis. In a pair programming setting, you will get access to a portion of our system and will debug an Error we’ve introduced or build a prototype of a new feature.
Onboarding

If you and our team both see a great culture and technical fit, we will send you a job offer and walk you through our onboarding process.

In your first week, you will ship your very own first feature to production! We will prepare a great first task, help you along the way and celebrate the release and direct user feedback."

Growth. It’s a pretty big word around the Pleo’sphere right now.

Wowzas. It sounds pretty ambitious when you write it down like that. And why do we need to grow so much? Well because we set ourselves a target of reaching 1 million active users by 2025…..

Good grief! What are we doing to ourselves? Well we’re shooting for the moon! It’s pretty exciting stuff, but it’s also pretty daunting, and that’s where you come in.

Engineers are the backbone of all we do at Pleo. Without these wildly brilliant people, we don’t have a thing. And with all this growth we are looking for some wicked talented Senior Backend Engineers to support and lead our product in some pretty exciting (and experimental!) directions.

This means finding people who know server-side languages like the back of their hand. People who devour cloud environments for breakfast, have dipped a toe (even jumped right in) to DevOps, and who delve into relational databases and shell scripting like it aint no thang.

But it’s not just about being a master of your craft, it’s about ownership, and taking the lead on large projects such as product launches, managing migrations, and building core components used across the company. Sometimes it gets a bit crazy over here, so you might need to whip that compass out to navigate ambiguity and manage scope - the team will look to you to create a clear path forward.

Mostly, we’re looking for people others can look up to and learn from - you’ll set the standard for the team, not just in code but in culture too. At Pleo our culture is pretty special to us, and we value trust and transparency like you wouldn’t believe. Plus, you know, we want to enjoy what we do and who we are working with because duh.

We’re up for it, are you?

You know your way around

Server-side languages (we mostly use Kotlin and TypeScript but we know you can learn new languages)
Cloud environments/ distributed systems/ microservices (AWS, Google Cloud, Kubernetes)
Relational databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, Spanner)
Testing frameworks (Cypress, JUnit, Testcontainers)
Observability and monitoring (Datadog)
DevOps culture and tools (GitHub Actions, Gradle, Terraform)

Your colleagues would say you

Work in English with ease (it's our company language)
Know that Go is more than a board game
Never stop being curious and love learning about new languages/ frameworks/ working styles
Have experience solving complex technical challenges at scale
Ensure a high bar for quality and reliability on your team
Coach others on your team to help them develop as engineers
Advocate for a more thorough code review process than a quick scroll to the bottom of the page and a “LGTM!”
You don’t just write code, you help to design the overall solution
Would be a person that they would actually like to have a coffee with (virtual or not)

Show Me The Benefits

Your own Pleo card (no more out-of-pocket spending)
Ability to work remotely or onsite if you want to
Yearly trips to somewhere for team camps (both company-wide ones and team-specific ones)
Investment in learning & developing (just check with your team for what’s reasonable, we don’t have set budgets)

And here are some other nice gestures that we do

Sponsored lunch
25 days holidays (annual)
Loads of weird and wonderful niche communities to join in the company (we’re talking guerrilla gardening, liquids tasting, the Pleo band, learning to code initiatives, beer brewing, skiing, that type of thing)
Wild enthusiasm and encouragement from us if you want to host MeetUps, events, etc - we’ll help (venue, food, etc.)

Why join us?

Working at Pleo means you're working on something very exciting: the future of work. Through fintech we've seen a way to impact how people work; we think company spending should be delegated to all employees and teams, that it should be as automated as possible, and that it should drive a culture of responsible spending. Based on some pretty amazing Series C-round investment in 2021 we think we're onto something big.

So, in a nutshell, that's Pleo. Today we are a 800+ team, from over 100 nations, sitting in our Copenhagen HQ, London, Stockholm, Berlin, Madrid, Montreal, or Lisbon offices —and quite a few full-time remotes in 35 other countries! Being HQ'd out of Copenhagen means we're inspired by sensible things like a good work-life balance. If you don't work in the office with us we'll help you get up the best remote setup possible and will fly you in for our amazing team camps ✈️

About Your Application

Please submit your application in English; it’s our company language so you’ll be speaking lots of it if you join 💕
We treat all candidates equally: If you are interested please apply through our application system - any correspondence should come from there! Our lovely support isn't able to pass on any calls/ emails our way - and this makes sure that the candidate experience is smooth and fair to everyone 😊
We’re on a mission to make everyone feel valued at work. That’s only achievable if our team reflects the diversity of the world around us - and that starts with you, hitting apply, even if you are worried you might not tick all the boxes! We embrace and encourage people from all backgrounds to apply - regardless of race/ethnicity, colour, religion, nationality, gender, sex, sexual orientation, age, marital status, disability, neurodiversity, socio-economic status, culture or beliefs

At Jamf, people are at the core of everything we do. We do what’s right for our customers, our employees, our communities and our world. We take pride in simplifying technology for tens of thousands of customers around the globe and helping organizations succeed with Apple.

This role is remote in the Czech Republic. We are only able to accept applications for those based in theCzech Republic or have sponsorship to live and work in the Czech Republic.

What you'll do at Jamf:

At Jamf, we empower people to be their best selves and do their best work. You will join a unit of Cloud Engineers that contribute to Jamf Security portfolio.

If Data is the new gold and you are the King of Data… what does that make you? Not sure, but you are certainly a DBA! And if you are the type of DBA that is not married to a particular technology, likes to get his hands dirty and is interested in everything related to databases then you might be what we are looking for to scale our DBA team.

What we need from you:

The DBA Team owns many core database clusters in Production as well several other instances on a wide range of technologies. You will work alongside the rest of our DBAs in a small and agile team that owns their direction of travel.

And if you are not scared of doing some coding, you can get involved in how we build and monitor our DBs, using technologies like Terraform and Prometheus.

Some of the traits we expect from you:
No challenge is too big or too small for you. You get excited at the prospect of a complex project and at the same time you understand that small improvements can sometimes make a massive difference.
You hold yourself and your team to a high standard when working in production.
You have some cloud experience, ideally with AWS.
You have experience with at least 2 different DB technologies as well as awesome SQL skills and ideally NoSQL as well. We use Dremio, Vertica, Mongo as well as other technologies. But we won’t frown upon you if Oracle is your cup of tea.

Description

Our vision is clear. Arming companies with the insights to ensure every piece of software built or bought is safe. That every threat is detected, and the deployment risks are well understood. An innovative vision requires creative people to help forge this transformational journey at ReversingLabs. ReversingLabs is recognized by the cybersecurity industry as a leader in innovation. Investment from Crosspoint capital of $56M will support our growth and efforts to build scalable, automated and intelligent software security solutions.

In this day and age, with systems and people under attack day and night by highly advanced cyber threats, a swift but detailed analysis of current threats and attack vectors is necessary. Given the number of such attacks, this is no small feat. As a member of the threat detection team, your focus will be on identifying malicious threats, behaviors, components, and exposure risks (such as vulnerabilities) of various applications, and to provide actionable intelligence for our customers and community on how to improve their security posture. You will often have to put yourself in the attacker’s shoes, correlate even the tiniest clues with millions of metadata records, and try to connect the dots to completely understand the impact. Finally, to automatically identify threats and risks, you will need to transform your knowledge into a rule-based format that our analysis solutions understand, effectively shielding other potential victims.

We will guide you through the details of various file formats so you can better understand the foundation of our work. You will familiarize yourself with the way applications are structured, learn how to identify benign or malicious behavior, and how to use popular and in-house developed technologies for analysis. Working alongside industry experts, you will understand how your work ties into our overall product offering, and get feedback on the impact of your work.

Of course, we don’t expect you to be able to tackle threats right off the bat. Based on your skill level, you will undergo a specially crafted training during the first few months to sharpen your skills before entering the arena. Do you have what it takes?

Responsibilities

Keeping track of the latest cybersecurity threats
Providing timely and accurate analyses of threat capabilities
Identifying and analyzing software, and providing actionable feedback to improve security

Think “lab” and not “agency”. We get excited about solving business problems, not creating advertising for the sake of making advertising. Our entrepreneurship DNA runs deep. We’re willing to break rules, try new things, and test hypotheses if it means better understanding our craft. It’s fun!
We believe 100% that brands can be built on digital platforms and part of our model is built bottom up, flipping the traditional advertising model and process on its head. We don’t play to agency/industry norms and our culture and energy reflects that.
Our environment (and pace) feels much more like a start-up than most agencies you might be used to. Hopefully that, and the opportunity to collaborate with the talented and enthusiastic crew, work with big brands excites you, as it does us. We can’t wait to meet you.
VaynerMedia is an Equal Opportunity Employer. This means that VaynerMedia provides equal employment opportunities to all staff members and job applicants without regard to gender, pregnancy, marital or civil partnership status, gender reassignment, race, disability, sexual orientation, religious belief, part time or fixed term employment, age or any other legally protected class.

Tendrás la posibilidad de utilizar un amplio espectro de tecnologías innovadoras para la construcción de soluciones de gestión de datos bajo diversos paradigmas de procesamiento y modelado, aplicando para ello los principios adecuados en términos de desarrollo y arquitectura.

Asimismo, gracias a nuestro path de especialista tendrás la oportunidad de crecer como ingeniero y/o arquitecto Big Data, contando con herramientas y recursos para tu continuo aprendizaje y crecimiento profesional, al mismo tiempo que te involucras en diversos retos que permitan tanto a SDG Group como a nuestros clientes explotar al máximo el valor de sus datos.



Responsabilidades:

Darás tu opinión técnica sobre los procesos y arquitecturas que se desarrollen para nutrir las conversaciones técnicas que se llevan a cabo durante las fases de diseño de la misma, priorizando estrategias dirigidas por metadatos y fundamentadas en DataOps.
Participarás en la toma de requerimientos necesarios para arquitecturas y pipelines de datos.
También llevarás a cabo tareas de desarrollo con diferentes tecnologías, aunque principalmente usamos Spark (tanto para procesos en batch como streaming). Adicionalmente, y aunque nuestros desarrollos habitualmente no se basen en SQL, es importante que tengas la soltura suficiente para hacer exploración de datos.
Somos bastante agnósticos a la tecnología y a la infraestructura en nuestros proyectos, así que es posible que tengas experiencia proyectos en AWS, Azure, GCP u on-premises, por lo que será importante que no te importe estar cambiando de entorno con frecuencia.
A veces también nos toca crear u optimizar tiempos de respuesta en motores de búsqueda, así que cualquier experiencia en Solr o Elastic nos gustará.
Además, en algunos momentos también necesitaremos hacer pruebas de concepto y pruebas con tecnologías nuevas en el mercado y servicios cloud nuevos o que creamos que puedan ser útiles para nuestros proyectos o clientes, por lo que también podrás colaborar en tareas de innovación."
