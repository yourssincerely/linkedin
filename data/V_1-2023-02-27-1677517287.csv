You have experience in software development and you are interested in data visualization tools.
You are customer-oriented — you want to understand customer needs and how the product is used.

You have firsthand experience (either professional or personal) building a real product.

About The Job

Our Mid-level Backend Engineer positions require true ‘Engineers’ with Product based mindsets. You will be joining a team of Engineers who come from backgrounds in solving complex software engineering challenges, accustomed to working in a proactive manner, identifying areas for improvement and implementing these effectively.

The role will require you to utilise your knowledge of best-practice software development principles where you can design, develop and implement new features for our SaaS platform, whilst making our product even more scalable and awesome.

Building new features and technological innovations in our Node.js back-end as part of one of our Development Teams
Understand and help define our platform's architecture together with the team
Challenge our product and team members to continuously develop themselves and our product

Besides fun to work with, you...

Are great at modelling business domains into data models

Soy Víctor, cofundador de Planet 🌍, la única plataforma de automatización y gestión de precios para Shopify en español. Actualmente contamos con más de 500 clientes, con presencia en ¡+65 países diferentes!

Por ello, estamos ampliando nuestro equipo con un programador Front-end para el desarrollo de nuevas funcionalidades para nuestra plataforma. 💻🤙🏻

Qué ofrecemos:
Una oportunidad de escapar de los desarrollos monolíticos. Cada mes lanzamos una funcionalidad nueva, dando pie a progresar con tus conocimientos de desarrollo, y evitar la monotonía de hacer las mismas tareas una y otra vez.
Una organización horizontal donde se tienen en cuenta las diversas opiniones e ideas a la hora de tomar decisiones.
Un entorno de trabajo distendido al máximo. Nos consideramos una familia, y basamos nuestra cultura en la confianza y la cercanía 😊.
El mejor sitio para crecer. Avanzamos rápido, experimentando y aprendiendo juntos.
Horario flexible elegido por la persona. Trabajo por sprints, basado en metodología Scrum.
Salario: 23-27k€ anuales.

Qué puedes esperar de tus primeros meses en Planet:
El primer mes te pondrás a punto para poder desarrollar: aprenderás a usar nuestra plataforma y conocerás sus puntos fuertes y mejorables, prepararás tu entorno de desarrollo y aprenderás a usar las herramientas que tenemos en Front. Podrás ver cómo nos coordinamos e incluso haber colaborado en alguna tarea de desarrollo menor.
En el segundo mes habrás desplegado cambios menores en nuestro sistema de diseño y nuestras extensiones de Shopify con la ayuda de tu mentor.
En el tercer mes te habrás enfrentado a una tarea de desarrollo dentro de nuestra plataforma y para las extensiones de Shopify. Será un mes donde experimentarás a fondo con los stacks de cada entorno.
Al cabo de seis meses esperamos que ya sepas qué se puede y no se puede hacer con la API de Shopify, que participes en el diseño de nuevos addons y que puedas afrontar nuevos desarrollos en la plataforma (siempre con la ayuda de tus compañeros :)).
El objetivo final es que con el tiempo lideres el desarrollos de addons para la sección de automatizaciones, proponiendo soluciones que se adapten a los requisitos y limitaciones de Shopify.

Requisitos técnicos:
Conocimientos demostrables en el desarrollo con Angular o dos años de experiencia laboral en desarrollo web.
El prototipado se desarrolla en Figma y se maqueta en HTML5 y SCSS. Disponemos de una línea de diseño para simplificar este proceso.
Conocimientos básicos de patrones de diseño e interés por desarrollar código que sea fácil de mantener.
La mayor parte de los desarrollos parten de cero, por lo que priman las buenas prácticas. Esto permite ir actualizando las versiones sobre una base sólida y robusta para todo el equipo.
Experiencia con Git.
Conocimientos básicos de MongoDB.
MongoDB es nuestro motor de BBDD principal por lo que cualquier funcionalidad que desarrolles pasará por comunicarte con ella.
Para pruebas, debbuging e incidencias será necesario consultar directamente a la base de datos, por lo que, si tienes experiencia previa te resultará de gran ayuda.
No es necesario conocer todas las tecnologías de nuestro stack, pero sí especial interés por aprender y trabajar con ellas. En el día a día, desarrollarás en Angular@14, pero entrarás en contacto con nuestra infraestructura de AWS, sistema de logs y demás tecnologías.

También, es deseable:
Nos gustan las personas resolutivas, que no tengan miedo a enfrentarse a nuevas situaciones y a trabajar desde la terminal.
El interés por explorar todos los campos y tecnologías es algo esencial; siempre estamos buscando cómo optimizar nuestros procesos, aunque implique integrarnos con otras plataformas o usar otras librerías.
El inglés es algo esencial. Desarrollarás funcionalidad para una plataforma que se usa por todo el mundo; por lo que ayudar en la internacionalización de los textos y tener en cuenta el formateo de números y moneda es parte del día a día."

We raised our Series C funding in March 2022 for $105M at a $2.1B valuation. We continued to see exponential revenue growth last year. Join us for a whale of a ride!

About Us

Docker is a remote first company with employees across Europe and the Americas. We value transparency and asynchronous communication, but also arrange meetups and offsites to allow people to work together in person.

At Docker, we empower developers to make world-changing apps. Docker helps developers bring their ideas to reality by conquering the complexity of app development using container images. The Supply Chain team is looking to solve the following problems:
What insights can we give developers about their images and build processes?
How can developers keep their software dependencies up to date and secure?
What data can we put at developers' fingertips to supercharge their daily work?
How can developers build on expertise and pre-existing solutions within their organization?

To solve these problems, the Supply Chain team experiments on and delivers various features using data, iterating quickly on prototypes inside Docker Desktop, Docker Hub, and a new cross-registry initiative. We’re centered around a large data plane with integrations to container registries and source control systems. We use this data to provide developers with insights and new functionality.

Who We’re Looking For

We have a variety of backend opportunities at different parts of the stack, including infrastructure and platform engineering, integrations with other web services, and customer-facing applications on both web and desktop, and we welcome applicants who are interested in any of these areas. We use various languages, but particularly Golang.

We work in a multi-cloud environment, making use of the best parts of GCP and AWS. We use a variety of databases including Datomic, Postgres and DynamoDB. Much of the backend is asynchronous and queues are center stage in our architecture. We use Kubernetes to run our services, and serverless technology where appropriate. Our services build automatically and are deployed into production with a click of a button. We believe in making small changes and deploying regularly.

The ideal candidate will have a strong desire to investigate and learn new technologies. In return, we offer you the unique opportunity to build world-class tools to help millions of developers like you.

3+ years experience in backend engineering.

Modern marketing and product teams all over the world use Vero to automate communications with hundreds of millions of end-users.

With nearly a decade's experience in this space Vero is undergoing a transformation that is putting it on an exciting new trajectory. We've recently launched a new take on our product: a version that sits directly on top of customers' data platforms like Redshift, Google BigQuery, Snowflake and more. This is a massive shift that gives teams easier access to their data, faster and for less cost.

Vero is looking for a Site Reliability/Platform Engineer to join us on our journey and to help us build the future of messaging automation.

As a company, Vero works hard to ensure a friendly and empathetic working environment. We aim for as little politics and ego as possible, we believe in inclusivity and work to understand and support each other at every turn. We're proud of our culture and if these values sound on point to you, we'd love to hear from you!

About the role
We’re looking for a senior platform engineer to architect, develop and manage our infrastructure. Along with the other members of our platform team you will be responsible for the reliability, security and scalability of our infrastructure.

You will have strong practical experience with AWS, Docker and Terraform. You have real world experience with real-time, event-driven data pipelines and technologies such as Kafka. You have experience in scaling SQL-based data stores such as PostgreSQL (Amazon RDS, Aurora).

You will be on call as part of our platform team rotation. We have platform team members in the USA and in Australia and your rotation will generally be during standard daylight working hours CET. You will be on call during weekends (and your compensation will reflect this).

Vero believes in sustainable growth. Our default posture is not ""billion dollars or bust"". As a result, we are a small team that deliver big things. You need to be a “manager of one” to succeed in this role.

Responsibilities
Implement changes that improve the stability and reliability of our existing platform. Think ahead and build for the future as opposed to bandaid fixes for today. We aim to balance “getting things done” with work that improves our velocity and long-term outcomes.
Build robust, easy-to-use foundational platforms and tools that enable engineering teams to provision services rapidly, consistently, and securely.
Develop tools and applications that use clean, efficient code, ensuring code quality and standards.
Be part of our on-call rotation, owning the EU hours 9am-5pm CET, and respond to operational incidents during on-call hours.

About you
Does this sound like you?
You are interested in building for the long-term, have a strong problem-solving ability and the aptitude to consider the big picture when solving engineering challenges.
You have a passion for building high quality web application experiences.
You strive for elegant solutions that are as simple and effective as possible.
You have an interest in and respect for both the latest technologies available on cloud providers, as well as traditional solutions.
You have excellent communication skills and a willingness to collaborate on ideas.

Requirements
Must-haves:
Experience and strong interest in databases and data storage (PostgreSQL, Redshift), key-value stores, messaging, and distributed systems.
Experience delivering projects at scale and making sound engineering choices to set us up for future growth and success.
Analytical mind with problem-solving aptitude.
A strong fundamental understanding of backend components such as databases, web protocols and networking.
Coding/scripting knowledge in Bash, Ruby, Python, Java or a C-based language.
Ability to work independently.
Experience working in remote teams.
Nice-to-haves:
Experience with Go or Rust.
BSc/BA in Computer Science or a related degree.
Contributions to major open source projects.

Benefits
Competitive salary. We pay in the top quartile, based on Sydney (AU) salary data wherever you are located. Sydney has a similar cost of living to cities like Tel Aviv, Austin, Portland, Oslo and more: making it very competitive. We pay everyone the same, regardless of geography.
Flexible work. Work in the way that produces your best results. Many of our team members work from home one day a week, others come to the office every day and many are completely remote. We’re committed to helping you feel like you can be the happiest and most productive you.
Yearly team conference. We host an annual team conference to get together as a team, challenge the status-quo and expand our vision for the future.
Parental leave. We offer a generous parental leave policy.

Vero is an equal opportunity employer. We are a participant in programs like Project F's Program 50/50 and are endorsed by Australia's Work180. These programs help us identify underlying systemic and environmental issues that are known to derail women in careers in technology so that we can address them head on and create a truly equal workplace."

Help define Service Level Objectives to assess release readiness of all services
Develop software, tooling, and processes to automate our operations
Measure and optimize system performance
Participate in incident management on-call rotation and drive root cause analysis

At Open Systems SREs are driven by improving the operations of our services, measured by the level of service that we provide to our customers, the resources that we need to operate our services, and the interest of our operational work in our Mission Control NOC. SREs work in partnership with platform and service engineering teams in different capacity—from consulting to joint engineering projects—to drive the operational improvements across the entire lifecycle of our services.

As part of your SRE responsibilities, and through the Open Systems training and courses, you will become certified as a Mission Control Engineer, providing you with knowledge in a wide area covering networking and security topics.

Interpersonal skills, ability to collaborate and build trust across teams to design and deliver shared solutions

You may already have experience with the whole breadth of the SRE role already, but do not let it stop you if you do not. We also support you making a transition to SRE from a strong skillset in software engineering, DevOps, or platform engineering. In that case you should be able to explain why would want to make this transition.

Our Support Engineers are constantly learning a wide range of customer systems and technical concepts and are thrilled by the new and exciting challenges that they encounter each day.

To accurately identify the source and solution of an issue, this team will take the time to learn about the customer’s business and systems while helping to improve their fundamental SingleStore and database operational knowledge. This often requires additional research and time spent on learning new technologies and tools outside of just the database engine while also being deeply engaged with multiple departments including development teams, query performance engineering, product management, infrastructure SREs, etc.

Role And Responsibilities

Provide product support to our on-premise and cloud hosted enterprise customers, acting as the first-line-of-defense for complex technical issues, bug diagnosis, or resolving critical outages.
Identify and reproduce product issues and submit formal bug reports or feature requests to the appropriate Engineering team.
Understand and help to improve complex SQL behavior to diagnose bugs or improve performance.
Collaborate with software developers, sales engineers, and technical account managers to keep all teams up to date with current issues a customer may be facing.
Work to streamline and improve various Support and Engineering processes and tools, author new knowledge base articles and run-books, and help the team continually improve efficiency and effectiveness.
Participate in our on-call rotation that may include weekends and holidays.

Required Skills And Experience

4+ years of previous customer-facing advanced technical support experience.
Previous experience as a DBA or Support Engineer at a database company.
Experience with SQL databases and advanced SQL query optimization and tuning. You should be familiar enough with at least one commercial or open source database to decipher its EXPLAIN plan and understand potential performance impact or ways to improve the query.
Strong background in general product troubleshooting, keeping in mind that query processing issues can be impacted by database or linux configuration and resource availability.
A solid linux performance background. That means you are hands-on with Linux and your skills include generating and reading flame graphs, checking system resource utilization, and parsing verbose log files. Bonus points for familiarity with Kubernetes.
Experience with a scripting or coding language. Whether it’s C++, Python, Go, or Bash, you should have a go-to solution for quick problem-solving and be able to navigate through our extensive code base.
Familiarity with distributed systems and AWS/GCP. You understand how organizations deploy and maintain distributed applications and services across multiple machines and know how to analyze these systems for performance bottlenecks.
Experience improving support processes regarding ticket triage, escalation, and reporting business metrics back to the organization.
Strong written and verbal English communication skills. Have the ability to explain technical concepts to a wide range of end-users.

SingleStore is one platform for all data, built so you can engage with insight in every moment. Trusted by industry leaders, SingleStore enables enterprises to adapt to change as it happens, embrace diverse data with ease, and accelerate the pace of innovation. SingleStore is venture-backed and headquartered in San Francisco with offices in Portland, Seattle, Boston, Bangalore, London, Lisbon, and Kyiv. Defining the future starts with The Database of Now™.

We raised our Series C funding in March 2022 for $105M at a $2.1B valuation. We continued to see exponential revenue growth last year. Join us for a whale of a ride!

About Us

Docker is a remote first company with employees across Europe and the Americas. We value transparency and asynchronous communication, but also arrange meetups and offsites to allow people to work together in person.

At Docker, we empower developers to make world-changing apps. Docker helps developers bring their ideas to reality by conquering the complexity of app development using container images. The Supply Chain team is looking to solve the following problems:
What insights can we give developers about their images and build processes?
How can developers keep their software dependencies up to date and secure?
What data can we put at developers' fingertips to supercharge their daily work?
How can developers build on expertise and pre-existing solutions within their organization?

To solve these problems, the Supply Chain team experiments on and delivers various features using data, iterating quickly on prototypes inside Docker Desktop, Docker Hub, and a new cross-registry initiative. We’re centered around a large data plane with integrations to container registries and source control systems. We use this data to provide developers with insights and new functionality.

Who We’re Looking For

We have a variety of backend opportunities at different parts of the stack, including infrastructure and platform engineering, integrations with other web services, and customer-facing applications on both web and desktop, and we welcome applicants who are interested in any of these areas. We use various languages, but particularly Golang.

We work in a multi-cloud environment, making use of the best parts of GCP and AWS. We use a variety of databases including Datomic, Postgres and DynamoDB. Much of the backend is asynchronous and queues are center stage in our architecture. We use Kubernetes to run our services, and serverless technology where appropriate. Our services build automatically and are deployed into production with a click of a button. We believe in making small changes and deploying regularly.

The ideal candidate will have a strong desire to investigate and learn new technologies. In return, we offer you the unique opportunity to build world-class tools to help millions of developers like you.

Qualifications
3+ years experience in backend engineering.
Proficiency in modern programming languages.
Comfortable following software engineering best practices such as code review, source control, continuous integration, and testing.

To achieve that we are building a new community around Python opscode for open source applications, running on Kubernetes. We want to move all of Canonical and Ubuntu IS onto this new, open source codebase.

We are confident that we can dramatically improve the experience of running complex business operations - and then we can help our customers embrace those new techniques and products.

Our customers are at the forefront of some of the most interesting data in the world, using SingleStore to push the boundaries every day. To do this well, they leverage the expertise of our Support Engineering Team, composed of technical subject matter experts on the frontlines of critical customer issues.

This Support Engineering role skews far more towards engineering than typical technical support as you will need to delve into database internals and memory allocators, diagnose complex SQL query behavior, and investigate Linux and Kubernetes related configurations, all in the name of resolving complex product issues. Our Support Engineers are constantly learning a wide range of customer systems and technical concepts and are thrilled by the new and exciting challenges that they encounter each day.

To accurately identify the source and solution of an issue, this team will take the time to learn about the customer’s business and systems while helping to improve their fundamental SingleStore and database operational knowledge. This often requires additional research and time spent on learning new technologies and tools outside of just the database engine while also being deeply engaged with multiple departments including development teams, query performance engineering, product management, infrastructure SREs, etc.

Role And Responsibilities

Provide product support to our on-premise and cloud hosted enterprise customers, acting as the first-line-of-defense for complex technical issues, bug diagnosis, or resolving critical outages.
Identify and reproduce product issues and submit formal bug reports or feature requests to the appropriate Engineering team.
Understand and help to improve complex SQL behavior to diagnose bugs or improve performance.
Collaborate with software developers, sales engineers, and technical account managers to keep all teams up to date with current issues a customer may be facing.
Work to streamline and improve various Support and Engineering processes and tools, author new knowledge base articles and run-books, and help the team continually improve efficiency and effectiveness.
Participate in our on-call rotation that may include weekends and holidays.

Required Skills And Experience

4+ years of previous customer-facing advanced technical support experience.
Previous experience as a DBA or Support Engineer at a database company.
Experience with SQL databases and advanced SQL query optimization and tuning. You should be familiar enough with at least one commercial or open source database to decipher its EXPLAIN plan and understand potential performance impact or ways to improve the query.
Strong background in general product troubleshooting, keeping in mind that query processing issues can be impacted by database or linux configuration and resource availability.
A solid linux performance background. That means you are hands-on with Linux and your skills include generating and reading flame graphs, checking system resource utilization, and parsing verbose log files. Bonus points for familiarity with Kubernetes.
Experience with a scripting or coding language. Whether it’s C++, Python, Go, or Bash, you should have a go-to solution for quick problem-solving and be able to navigate through our extensive code base.
Familiarity with distributed systems and AWS/GCP. You understand how organizations deploy and maintain distributed applications and services across multiple machines and know how to analyze these systems for performance bottlenecks.
Experience improving support processes regarding ticket triage, escalation, and reporting business metrics back to the organization.
Strong written and verbal English communication skills. Have the ability to explain technical concepts to a wide range of end-users.

SingleStore is one platform for all data, built so you can engage with insight in every moment. Trusted by industry leaders, SingleStore enables enterprises to adapt to change as it happens, embrace diverse data with ease, and accelerate the pace of innovation. SingleStore is venture-backed and headquartered in San Francisco with offices in Portland, Seattle, Boston, Bangalore, London, Lisbon, and Kyiv. Defining the future starts with The Database of Now™.

Consistent with our commitment to diversity & inclusion, we value individuals with the ability to work on diverse teams and with a diverse range of people.

Telnyx is a global connectivity platform and partner that powers carrier-grade services on an in-house built, private, cloud-agnostic IP network. We power voice, messaging, video, wireless, numbering, fax, security, and networking solutions for businesses all around the world. Whether we’re processing mission-critical communications, hosting enterprise-grade contact centers, or powering simple in-app messaging and calling, our APIs make secure, high-fidelity connectivity the new standard. We’re working to democratize worldwide access to real-time communications over the internet.

The Role

We’re looking for a Mobile App Engineer to work on our iOS and Android Voice & Video SDKs, that enable our customers to add real-time communications into their apps. Telnyx’s SDKs are building blocks from which customers create voice, video and data applications of the future, leveraging our world-wide network for the highest quality real-time streaming. This role is for a seasoned engineer looking for an experience leading native mobile efforts at a fast-paced startup.

In This Role You Will

Lead Telnyx native mobile projects, starting with our Voice and Video SDKs.
Collaborate with telephony and web developers to create iOS and Android SDKs with a laser focus on developer experience.
Make improvements to native mobile projects based on early adopters feedback.
Craft durable, well-tested code with an unwavering commitment to product quality.
Create sample applications and work with our Sales Engineers to display Voice and Video applications to potential customers.
Learn the technology behind voice and video calls and how to use it to enable applications that connect people through our world-wide private network.

You’d Be A Good Fit If You Have

Experience working on challenging iOS and Android projects in an agile environment, using Swift, Objective-C, Kotlin, or Java.
Published native mobile open-source libraries.
You take a thoughtful approach to decision making, knowing when to move fast and when to long-term optimize.
You want to work in a fast-paced, product-driven environment.
You keep up to date with the latest frontend technologies and patterns, and enjoy sharing what you’ve learned.
You’re interested in creating proof of concepts with cutting edge technologies.
You’re willing to learn the telephony technology behind voice and video calls.

What It Is Like To Work At Telnyx

Telnyx is a complex machine with a simple purpose: connect people. We are an intelligent telephony engine, the beating heart of the Telnyx service that routes data along the pathways of our global, private network. We are drop-in APIs for hooking applications into our products, and an administrator portal that puts unprecedented control of configuring and orchestrating the Telnyx service into our customers’ hands.

We’re also an organization of industry experts and engineers focused on solving problems and building solutions. We’re a concierge customer success team and a 24/7 support team. We’re a communications partner, focused on agile and endless innovation, not a telecom slogged in antiquated processes and anti-competitive regulation. We keep the conversation going: the always-on, omnichannel, enriched conversation that the modern world demands.

Communications are coming untethered from devices, and more and more, they’re migrating into our everyday platforms: our social media, our work applications, and our collaboration tools. But, that move started before there was infrastructure to support it—the modern internet will never offer the speed and consistency that real-time communications require. So, we built a network that does and a cloud platform tuned for real-time communications at every layer. Telnyx is the connective matrix, a worldwide nervous system, a high-speed rail tunneling through the information superhighway. We’re the foundation for calls, texts and messaging today, for the internet of things, augmented reality and “communitainment” tomorrow, and for whatever enterprising imaginations can dream up after that.

We’re Telnyx. We’re the future of communications.

At Telnyx, we're looking for people with passion, grit, and integrity. You're encouraged to apply even if your experience doesn't precisely match the job description. Your skills and passion will stand out—and set you apart—especially if your career has taken some extraordinary twists and turns. At Telnyx, we welcome diverse perspectives and people who think rigorously and aren't afraid to challenge assumptions. Join us.

Bring Your Authentic Self to Telnyx

Telnyx is committed to building a team full of diverse perspectives, various backgrounds and different minds. We believe diversity drives innovation. We are committed to building a culture where difference is valued and creating avenues of equity for underserved groups. While we are still a work in progress, we are actively seeking folks who are passionate about building a place of belonging for everyone.

How We Work

We’re a connectivity and networking leader, with industry experts and engineers who have built our cloud-agnostic platform in-house, from the ground up. We’re a concierge customer success team and a 24/7 support team. We’re a communications partner, focused on agile innovation, not a telecom slogged in antiquated processes and anti-competitive regulation. We’re an enterprise-grade conversation enabler, powering the global, enriched, multi-channel communications that today’s customers demand.

You may already have experience with the whole breadth of the SRE role already, but do not let it stop you if you do not. We also support you making a transition to SRE from a strong skillset in software engineering, DevOps, or platform engineering. In that case you should be able to explain why would want to make this transition.

What we offer:

You will join our growing SRE team, and work with agile method in coordination with software and product engineering teams.

Telnyx is a global connectivity platform and partner that powers carrier-grade services on an in-house built, private, cloud-agnostic IP network.

Whether we’re processing mission-critical communications, hosting enterprise-grade contact centers, or powering simple in-app messaging and calling, our APIs make secure, high-fidelity connectivity the new standard. We’re working to democratize worldwide access to real-time communications over the internet.

The Role

We’re looking for a Mobile App Engineer to work on our iOS and Android Voice & Video SDKs, that enable our customers to add real-time communications into their apps.

What It Is Like To Work At Telnyx

Telnyx is a complex machine with a simple purpose: connect people. We are an intelligent telephony engine, the beating heart of the Telnyx service that routes data along the pathways of our global, private network. We are drop-in APIs for hooking applications into our products, and an administrator portal that puts unprecedented control of configuring and orchestrating the Telnyx service into our customers’ hands.

We’re also an organization of industry experts and engineers focused on solving problems and building solutions. We’re a concierge customer success team and a 24/7 support team. We’re a communications partner, focused on agile and endless innovation, not a telecom slogged in antiquated processes and anti-competitive regulation. We keep the conversation going: the always-on, omnichannel, enriched conversation that the modern world demands.

Communications are coming untethered from devices, and more and more, they’re migrating into our everyday platforms: our social media, our work applications, and our collaboration tools. But, that move started before there was infrastructure to support it—the modern internet will never offer the speed and consistency that real-time communications require. So, we built a network that does and a cloud platform tuned for real-time communications at every layer. Telnyx is the connective matrix, a worldwide nervous system, a high-speed rail tunneling through the information superhighway. We’re the foundation for calls, texts and messaging today, for the internet of things, augmented reality and “communitainment” tomorrow, and for whatever enterprising imaginations can dream up after that.

We’re Telnyx. We’re the future of communications.

At Telnyx, we're looking for people with passion, grit, and integrity. You're encouraged to apply even if your experience doesn't precisely match the job description. Your skills and passion will stand out—and set you apart—especially if your career has taken some extraordinary twists and turns. At Telnyx, we welcome diverse perspectives and people who think rigorously and aren't afraid to challenge assumptions. Join us.

Bring Your Authentic Self to Telnyx

Telnyx is committed to building a team full of diverse perspectives, various backgrounds and different minds. We believe diversity drives innovation. We are committed to building a culture where difference is valued and creating avenues of equity for underserved groups. While we are still a work in progress, we are actively seeking folks who are passionate about building a place of belonging for everyone.

How We Work

We’re a connectivity and networking leader, with industry experts and engineers who have built our cloud-agnostic platform in-house, from the ground up. We’re a concierge customer success team and a 24/7 support team. We’re a communications partner, focused on agile innovation, not a telecom slogged in antiquated processes and anti-competitive regulation. We’re an enterprise-grade conversation enabler, powering the global, enriched, multi-channel communications that today’s customers demand.

We're looking for people with passion, grit, and integrity. We believe in transparency, proactivity, and mutual respect. We provide the high-grade tools that help you do your best work, and keep up the collaborative habits that help everyone stay in the loop. No matter where you're based or which team you’re on, you’re plugged in, supported, and helping to shape the future of communications.

You're encouraged to apply even if your experience doesn't precisely match the job description. Your skills and passion will stand out—and set you apart—especially if your career has taken some extraordinary twists and turns. At Telnyx, we welcome diverse perspectives, rigorous thinkers and assumption challengers. Are you ready to join us?"

Our mission: enable anyone to turn their passion into a business and bring people together through commerce. We’re building the future of ecommerce; an interactive community where creators can make a living off their passion.

Did we mention we’re high growth? In January 2021, Whatnot had 10 ambitious employees. Today, the Whatnot team is 160+ employees and will exceed 300 by year end. We’re hiring forward-thinking problem solvers across all functional areas. We recruit thoughtfully, can adapt quickly, and are scaling fully remotely .

📈 Opportunity Size

The e-commerce experience has been static for 20+ years and is one of the largest opportunities for disruption in the startup space today. Livestream shopping is a $300B GMV market in China and has grown 100% YoY. Retail is a $5T market opportunity!

💻 The role

Payments at Whatnot makes the money flow, and orders happen. The team’s scope is large, encompassing pay, fraud & shipping. Engineers own these entire flows from experience, to vendor integrations, to inhouse infrastructure. Last year we moved >$150m through these pipelines and shipped millions of products to users and this year we’re aiming to 10x those numbers.

To achieve these goals, we’re looking to make a number of substantial improvements to our systems and customer experiences including critical areas of the business like payment scale & reliability, increased payment options, fraud mitigation, advanced shipping options, and improved delivery times and bringing Whatnot to hundreds of millions more customers.

How do you know if you want to work at InnovationCast?

You seek to learn and want to grow personally and professionally. The real magic of innovation happens when committed people work smarter to turn ideas into new value. If we don’t become better at what we do, we won’t help our customers do the same. So if you value repetition more than discovery, this job is not for you.

You want to do work that matters for people who care. We’re a startup working to solve a big and relevant problem - one that won’t go away. Helping our customers to get better results through innovation management is - and will ever be - a work in progress. But it is so important and makes a difference for so many people, that the mission inspires you.

You welcome change and actually like to drive it. We strive to give our customers the best tools so they can keep making progress with innovation. This means that we have to experiment a lot with new ideas. As expected, some of them will work, others won’t. You need to be willing to be wrong, not afraid to make mistakes and actively learn from the process.

You don’t want to be micromanaged and want to bring actionable ideas to the team. Innovation is a team sport. Sometimes your work will seem tricky and confusing because you will be working on something that doesn’t exist yet. You will reflect on and understand our thinking and be humble to ask for help, and share difficulties and potential ways forward. But you don’t expect to be given a checklist. When you feel others may be wrong, you speak up and explain your point of view. You value honest communication.

You believe innovation and entrepreneurship can help companies change the way they work and how business is done. You may even want to become an entrepreneur. We’re set to use innovation management and entrepreneurship practices to provide software that helps companies think and act differently at scale. By opening innovation to employees, customers and partners, organizations can explore unforeseen possibilities and make real progress they couldn’t do on their own.

To achieve that we are building a new community around Python opscode for open source applications, running on Kubernetes. We want to move all of Canonical and Ubuntu IS onto this new, open source codebase.

We are confident that we can dramatically improve the experience of running complex business operations - and then we can help our customers embrace those new techniques and products. Traditionally, IS is an inward-facing operation. We would like to transform our IS team into an extension of the product engineering capability at Canonical. Our internal workloads are in many cases the same open source workloads that our customers want to operate. This team will productise those workloads for real-time automated operations on Kubernetes.

This role is ideal for software engineers who enjoy Python, have a passion for distributed systems, and an interest in the entire Linux stack - from kernel to networking to virtualization and containers. It is a role that requires rigour in both code and customer interactions. Our engineers are technically astute open source enthusiasts who are excited about cloud computing and are ready to join a global team charged with delivering world class services to our customers.

Strong Python development skills and familiarity with Kubernetes are key requirements of this role. You'll work closely with other teams in Canonical to ensure your products operate reliably, efficiently and scale to production sized workloads for our customers looking to adopt cutting-edge technology. You will participate and be responsible for ensuring sound software architecture and follow best practices in software quality, testing and documentation.

What you'll do
Work in Python to design and deliver open source software operations code
Work across the entire Linux stack, from kernel, networking, storage, to applications
Learn to think rigorously about application and infrastructure reliability
Shape high quality open source monitoring and alerting infrastructure
Simplify open source operations for our customers and open source community
Demonstrate sound engineering design and testing principles in your code
Follow agile software development practices
Coach and develop your colleagues where you have insights
Grow a healthy, collaborative engineering culture in line with company values
Work from home with global travel once or twice a year for up to 2 weeks for events

Who you are
You love technology and working with brilliant people
You have a Bachelor's or equivalent in Computer Science, STEM or similar degree
You are experienced with Linux systems administration, package management, and operations
You have hands-on experience with at least one public cloud
You are familiar with Docker and Kubernetes
You are an excellent Python programmer and enjoy challenging projects
You understand the importance of reliable software and strive to design and code to that expectation
You are organized and want your team to deliver timely, high quality software

About Canonical

Who are we

On a mission to make video easy for anyone …

Synthesia is the world's #1 AI video generation platform. Well, it's actually a video production studio — in a browser. As in, no cameras or film crews at all. You simply choose an avatar, enter your script in one of 60 languages, and your video is ready in minutes. In Synthesia, you can build personalised on-the-fly videos, give your chatbot a human face or run 24/7 weather channels in different languages, to name just a few of the possibilities. 🎬

We believe the future of media is synthetic, and we are on a mission to turn cameras into code and make everyone a creator. Not sure what we're talking about? Check out our brand video that explains what we're doing at Synthesia in a way that even our grandparents *kind of * understand what this AI video stuff is all about.

About The Position

In this position, you'll join our small (around 20) and extremely talented product team. You'll have a chance to work on scaling our current, fast-growing product and shape some of the next products in our pipeline.

Some of the projects our backend engineers work on include building out a custom video/audio rendering pipeline, implementing real-time collaboration/editing, optimising video delivery/streaming, solving scalability problems, etc.

We currently generate thousands of videos daily.

Requirements
You ideally have a minimum of 5+ years of experience working on backend
You have experience creating and maintaining large-scale solutions, preferably SaaS
You are very pragmatic in your approach and you don't over-engineer
You have the experience that ranges from early-stage start-ups to bigger, well-established organizations
You are on board to work in our stack
You know your distributed systems and are in this profession to solve complex technological problems
You have strong CS fundamentals
Experience with video rendering/streaming, optimizations for low-latency, or real-time editing (understanding concepts like OTs, CRDTs, etc.) is a huge plus
Good level of spoken and written English is required

How we work

We have a fast yet non-hacky development style. We work strictly with product managers who have a technical background. As a result, we do not overwhelm engineers with unrealistic expectations/requirements, and we can therefore move forward much faster. Well, we don't have unrealistic expectations/requirements in the first place, since we see our roadmap as a set of high-level goals and we have no fixed timelines on deploying features - we want to get things to production as fast as possible. We do that by pushing features behind a feature flag - so not all users see all features, but our production is always updated. This brings zero-downtime deployments, backward compatible features, and similar challenges since our users should never be impacted. We follow SCRUM loosely - our engineers have one sync meeting per week, async text Slack dailies, we have no dedicated QA people, we work in super small & independent teams, we have no Jira and in our team, we only have engineers, no code monkeys.

For us, it's simple: give people time to do deep work. And help specify features that are limited in scope while discouraging hacky workarounds.

It's early for us and we don't know how right we are yet. But after two years of building our product team and core engineering principles, we can see that we are on the right track. Progress over perfection.

Our stack & some context

We started to work on our main product - Synthesia STUDIO - almost two years ago with a very small team of engineers (BE and FS). We now have a functional MVP, that we develop, push forward and improve constantly. While we know, we have a long way to go, to bring our product to where we want it to be, we also have to be mindful of our existing userbase, which is also really involved with us and provides great feedback for each update and new feature we roll out. We have a lot of custom components and multiple layers of complexity, our product is constantly changing but if we try to sum up our stack:
Frontend is TypeScript/HTML/CSS using React.js + Redux;
Backend is a mix of Python, Flask, Node.js (for real-time cooperation), and C++ components (we have our own Chromium fork for headless video rendering) that are mostly containerized with Docker, and hosted on a number of AWS services (Lambda, Fargate, EC2, EKS)
We have a dedicated DevOps Engineer.

To achieve that we are building a new community around Python opscode for open source applications, running on Kubernetes. We want to move all of Canonical and Ubuntu IS onto this new, open source codebase.

We are confident that we can dramatically improve the experience of running complex business operations - and then we can help our customers embrace those new techniques and products. Traditionally, IS is an inward-facing operation. We would like to transform our IS team into an extension of the product engineering capability at Canonical. Our internal workloads are in many cases the same open source workloads that our customers want to operate. This team will productise those workloads for real-time automated operations on Kubernetes.

This role is ideal for software engineers who enjoy Python, have a passion for distributed systems, and an interest in the entire Linux stack - from kernel to networking to virtualization and containers. It is a role that requires rigour in both code and customer interactions. Our engineers are technically astute open source enthusiasts who are excited about cloud computing and are ready to join a global team charged with delivering world class services to our customers.

Strong Python development skills and familiarity with Kubernetes are key requirements of this role. You'll work closely with other teams in Canonical to ensure your products operate reliably, efficiently and scale to production sized workloads for our customers looking to adopt cutting-edge technology. You will participate and be responsible for ensuring sound software architecture and follow best practices in software quality, testing and documentation.

What you'll do
Work in Python to design and deliver open source software operations code
Work across the entire Linux stack, from kernel, networking, storage, to applications
Learn to think rigorously about application and infrastructure reliability
Shape high quality open source monitoring and alerting infrastructure
Simplify open source operations for our customers and open source community
Demonstrate sound engineering design and testing principles in your code
Follow agile software development practices
Coach and develop your colleagues where you have insights
Grow a healthy, collaborative engineering culture in line with company values
Work from home with global travel once or twice a year for up to 2 weeks for events

Who you are
You love technology and working with brilliant people
You have a Bachelor's or equivalent in Computer Science, STEM or similar degree
You are experienced with Linux systems administration, package management, and operations
You have hands-on experience with at least one public cloud
You are familiar with Docker and Kubernetes
You are an excellent Python programmer and enjoy challenging projects
You understand the importance of reliable software and strive to design and code to that expectation
You are organized and want your team to deliver timely, high quality software

About Canonical

Good initiative. Express yourself fully, often talk with your teammates and promote your ideas to the table, both for development and collaboration.

What You Can Expect from our Recruitment Process:

Apply here by uploading your CV in English and with contact information and we'll get back to you

Our engineers are technically astute open source enthusiasts who are excited about cloud computing and are ready to join a global team charged with delivering world class services to our customers.

Strong Python development skills and familiarity with Kubernetes are key requirements of this role. You'll work closely with other teams in Canonical to ensure your products operate reliably, efficiently and scale to production sized workloads for our customers looking to adopt cutting-edge technology. You will participate and be responsible for ensuring sound software architecture and follow best practices in software quality, testing and documentation.

What you'll do
Work in Python to design and deliver open source software operations code
Work across the entire Linux stack, from kernel, networking, storage, to applications
Learn to think rigorously about application and infrastructure reliability
Shape high quality open source monitoring and alerting infrastructure
Simplify open source operations for our customers and open source community

You are experienced with Linux systems administration, package management, and operations
You have hands-on experience with at least one public cloud
You are familiar with Docker and Kubernetes
You are an excellent Python programmer and enjoy challenging projects
You understand the importance of reliable software and strive to design and code to that expectation
You are organized and want your team to deliver timely, high quality software

Data visualization is often the most striking (and for some, the most accessible) part of the data-to-insights process. Let’s face it — there’s nothing more exciting than beautiful fit-for-purpose data viz.

We are looking for a talented software engineer to create usable, intuitive, beautiful interfaces and scalable engines for Dataiku DSS.

You are the ideal recruit if:

You have experience in software development and you are interested in data visualization tools.
You are customer-oriented — you want to understand customer needs and how the product is used.
You are at ease with both frontend and backend development, or you’ve mastered frontend development but are not afraid to dive into backend code to better understand how it works.
You know that a chart is worth a thousand grid cells.
You have firsthand experience (either professional or personal) building a real product.
You blink each time you see a misaligned pixel!

Work-life balance

Where possible, we like to enable people to work in ways that suit their working styles, which is why we have a hybrid-working model. Our teams generally like to have at least one team day per week at the office (the tasty lunch may be a factor), but besides that, it’s up to you and your team.

Relocation package: If you join Picnic from abroad, we’ll cover your trip to Düsseldorf, sponsor your Visa, and offer you a month of accommodation while you settle in (as long as regulations allow)

Soy Víctor, cofundador de Planet 🌍, la única plataforma de automatización y gestión de precios para Shopify en español. Actualmente contamos con más de 500 clientes, con presencia en ¡+65 países diferentes!

Por ello, estamos ampliando nuestro equipo con un programador Front-end para el desarrollo de nuevas funcionalidades para nuestra plataforma. 💻🤙🏻

Qué ofrecemos:
Una oportunidad de escapar de los desarrollos monolíticos. Cada mes lanzamos una funcionalidad nueva, dando pie a progresar con tus conocimientos de desarrollo, y evitar la monotonía de hacer las mismas tareas una y otra vez.
Una organización horizontal donde se tienen en cuenta las diversas opiniones e ideas a la hora de tomar decisiones.
Un entorno de trabajo distendido al máximo. Nos consideramos una familia, y basamos nuestra cultura en la confianza y la cercanía 😊.
El mejor sitio para crecer. Avanzamos rápido, experimentando y aprendiendo juntos.
Horario flexible elegido por la persona. Trabajo por sprints, basado en metodología Scrum.
Salario: 23-27k€ anuales.

Qué puedes esperar de tus primeros meses en Planet:
El primer mes te pondrás a punto para poder desarrollar: aprenderás a usar nuestra plataforma y conocerás sus puntos fuertes y mejorables, prepararás tu entorno de desarrollo y aprenderás a usar las herramientas que tenemos en Front. Podrás ver cómo nos coordinamos e incluso haber colaborado en alguna tarea de desarrollo menor.
En el segundo mes habrás desplegado cambios menores en nuestro sistema de diseño y nuestras extensiones de Shopify con la ayuda de tu mentor.
En el tercer mes te habrás enfrentado a una tarea de desarrollo dentro de nuestra plataforma y para las extensiones de Shopify. Será un mes donde experimentarás a fondo con los stacks de cada entorno.
Al cabo de seis meses esperamos que ya sepas qué se puede y no se puede hacer con la API de Shopify, que participes en el diseño de nuevos addons y que puedas afrontar nuevos desarrollos en la plataforma (siempre con la ayuda de tus compañeros :)).
El objetivo final es que con el tiempo lideres el desarrollos de addons para la sección de automatizaciones, proponiendo soluciones que se adapten a los requisitos y limitaciones de Shopify.

Requisitos técnicos:
Conocimientos demostrables en el desarrollo con Angular o dos años de experiencia laboral en desarrollo web.
El prototipado se desarrolla en Figma y se maqueta en HTML5 y SCSS. Disponemos de una línea de diseño para simplificar este proceso.
Conocimientos básicos de patrones de diseño e interés por desarrollar código que sea fácil de mantener.
La mayor parte de los desarrollos parten de cero, por lo que priman las buenas prácticas. Esto permite ir actualizando las versiones sobre una base sólida y robusta para todo el equipo.
Experiencia con Git.
Conocimientos básicos de MongoDB.
MongoDB es nuestro motor de BBDD principal por lo que cualquier funcionalidad que desarrolles pasará por comunicarte con ella.
Para pruebas, debbuging e incidencias será necesario consultar directamente a la base de datos, por lo que, si tienes experiencia previa te resultará de gran ayuda.
No es necesario conocer todas las tecnologías de nuestro stack, pero sí especial interés por aprender y trabajar con ellas. En el día a día, desarrollarás en Angular@14, pero entrarás en contacto con nuestra infraestructura de AWS, sistema de logs y demás tecnologías.

También, es deseable:
Nos gustan las personas resolutivas, que no tengan miedo a enfrentarse a nuevas situaciones y a trabajar desde la terminal.
El interés por explorar todos los campos y tecnologías es algo esencial; siempre estamos buscando cómo optimizar nuestros procesos, aunque implique integrarnos con otras plataformas o usar otras librerías.
El inglés es algo esencial. Desarrollarás funcionalidad para una plataforma que se usa por todo el mundo; por lo que ayudar en la internacionalización de los textos y tener en cuenta el formateo de números y moneda es parte del día a día."

We are breaking up our applications into microservices that are well tested, independently deployable and highly observable. We are empowering our teams to operate independently and to ship to production as frequently as they see fit. We’re looking for people who can help us to realise this vision and accelerate the journey, who know what great technology looks like and who can mentor our existing team.
