Backed by a renowned set of investors and partners including CapitalG, Tiger Global, and ICONIQ Growth, we’ve set out to build the future of AI.
 Data visualization is often the most striking (and for some, the most accessible) part of the data-to-insights process. Let’s face it — there’s nothing more exciting than beautiful fit-for-purpose data viz.
 We are looking for a talented software engineer to create usable, intuitive, beautiful interfaces and scalable engines for Dataiku DSS. Dataiku DSS brings together big data and AI technologies into a unique and easy-to-use platform. It allows data scientists to process data with SQL databases, Spark, and Kubernetes with either user-friendly interfaces or code. The same platform also allows business analysts to create powerful machines or deep learning models with just a few clicks.
  We design and code experiences that resonate with our growing customer base. We empower non-technical users with user-friendly and well-thought tools to let them quickly and efficiently visualize, analyze, or process their data.

We develop using Java, Spring, and Python on the backend.

 Write high-quality code, as your teammates do! 
 You are the ideal recruit if:
   You have experience in software development and you are interested in data visualization tools. 
 You are customer-oriented — you want to understand customer needs and how the product is used. 
 You are at ease with both frontend and backend development, or you’ve mastered frontend development but are not afraid to dive into backend code to better understand how it works. 
 You know that a chart is worth a thousand grid cells. 
 You have firsthand experience (either professional or personal) building a real product. 
 You blink each time you see a misaligned pixel! 
 You are humble and kind. You don't hesitate to ask questions when you don't know, and you treat your colleagues with respect, kindness, and honesty.

Organization and structure. You’re meticulously organized and superbly structured, so you can handle multiple tasks and responsibilities with poise and precision.
Pragmatism. Far from being too academic or obsessive in your perfectionism, you understand that speed is often as important as quality when getting things done in a competitive world.
Curiosity and initiative. You love exploring, and are forever hunting down new opportunities and testing fresh ideas. Rather than waiting to be told what to do, you go seek.
Passion. You love what you do, and your enthusiasm never wavers with the specifics of a given task or team. Whether you’re on a plane, train, or sofa, odds are that you’ll be found with your nose in a book or article on the subject.
Drive. You’re energetic and hard-working, and you persevere through adversity until the job is done—and done impeccably. You’re massively into getting results, and always aim for excellence in what you do.
Communication skills. You can pose questions with clarity and explain your reasoning concisely.
Proficiency in English. You read, write, and speak proficiently in English.
  Lots. Of. Data. With millions of users, hundreds of thousands of new users every day, and a large, diverse, and ever-growing portfolio of products, Bending Spoons is the perfect playground for a data nerd (we know you are—we are too!).
The finest tools. You get the best hardware on the market and all the software you could need. We can't wait to introduce you to our high-tech approach and our cutting-edge workflows.
Talented, knowledgeable colleagues. Learn from (and teach) some of the brightest and most skilled people you’ll ever meet. Your talent is going to blossom here.
Make a difference. Be the owner of your effort—from day one, you’re one of the team and fully trusted to take responsibility for your tasks. You’ll have every incentive to make a major impact.
Unique career opportunity. By joining a fast-growing company on a mission to become one of the world's greatest, it’s an unparalleled opportunity to turbocharge your learning and career prospects.
Continuous education. Spooners get unlimited backing for learning investments, including Italian or English lessons and things like courses, conferences, and books. There’s no permission or approval process—you’re fully trusted to use the company’s resources efficiently.
Flexible schedule. Our regular hours are 9-6 GMT+1, but this isn’t a “clock in, clock out” company. You’re fully trusted to create the right conditions for your own personal peak productivity. We only ask that you’re available to your teammates a good chunk of the day (six hours or so). That’s why it’s generally best to be based somewhere with a similar time zone—between GMT-2 and GMT+3.
Unlimited time off. Take all the time you need to be with your family or just recharge your batteries. There’s no maximum number of days off, and there isn't any kind of permission process. We just ask that you make your vacation decisions mindfully.
Remote working. Spend as much or as little time in our Milan office as you choose. Many Spooners like to change up their environment and get out of the city whenever the mood strikes. You’ve always got the freedom to decide where today’s office is.
Competitive salary and stock options. Our compensation package is highly competitive, and can grow rapidly and include stock options, depending on your performance and seniority.
 Commitment & contract
Full time or part-time. Permanent or fixed-term (depending on seniority).
 Location
Milan, Italy or fully remote.
If you choose the on-site option, it’s also fine to sometimes work remotely. We offer substantial support for relocation, including finding an apartment in Milan and paying the rent for 12 weeks.
 The selection process
If you successfully pass through our screening process, we’ll invite you to take on a few tests that assess how you approach and solve unfamiliar problems. These tests don’t require any prior knowledge, and they should take a few hours to complete. If you’re successful there, we’ll invite you to take part in some interviews—normally two or three—to get to know each other and figure out if it’s a good fit for both parties. The interviews are held remotely, and include some behavioral and problem-solving questions. To limit human bias, all of our hiring decisions are made by a hiring committee rather than any individual.
 Spooners come from all over the world and English is our working language. We welcome applications in English or Italian—whichever suits you best!
 All interviews and assessments take place in English and are held online.

Competitive salary and stock options. Our compensation package is highly competitive, and can grow rapidly and include stock options, depending on your performance and seniority.
 Permanent or fixed-term or internship. Full-time.
 Milan, Italy or fully remote.

You need to come expecting lots of hard work, massive development, and great responsibility.
 A few examples of your responsibilities:
Investigate the world through the customers’ eyes with the goal of understanding them and solving their problems. This entails extensive customer, market, and competitor research as well as close collaboration with our customer support team in the hunt for improvements and opportunities.
Study and improve the business model of your product, prioritizing initiatives with the highest potential to unlock significant value. Push teammates to do the same, so that as a group you realize the greatest ideation and implementation power possible.
Know your product’s numbers inside out and continuously analyze the data to solidly support your decision making.
Distill all the inputs into a strategy and a roadmap for your product, marrying wild ambition with rationality and pragmatism. Plan carefully and guide all stakeholders in executing the vision.

Tenacity. Once you have a goal, there’s no stopping you! Failure doesn’t discourage you—after every stumble, you get right back up and try again.
Common sense. Your judgment and intuition are sound and well grounded in reality.
Pragmatism. Far from being too academic or obsessive in your perfectionism, you understand that speed is often as important as quality when getting things done in a competitive world.

Competitive salary and stock options. Our compensation package is highly competitive, and can grow rapidly and include stock options, depending on your performance and seniority.
 Permanent or fixed-term or internship. Full-time.
 Milan, Italy or fully remote.
 If you successfully pass through our screening process, we’ll invite you to take on a few tests that assess how you approach and solve unfamiliar problems. If you’re successful there, we’ll invite you to take part in some interviews. We welcome applications in English and Italian.

ColorSensing is a startup from Universitat de Barcelona, developing a smart label for packaged foods. Our solution combines chemistry, computer vision, and artificial intelligence, and it is based on printing color-changing intelligent inks on an alternative QR code and using it as a multi-parametric sensor to check packaging integrity, food freshness and cold chain breaks. This way, we help food manufacturers and retailers reduce food waste and ensure food safety. You just need a smartphone to read the label, thanks to our proprietary color-correction algorithms. 
We also develop applications that need color correction or quantification for other industries such as healthtech. 
We’re a multidisciplinary young team, always willing to teach and learn by sharing knowledge, and expecting to grow and develop a variety of smart applications offering reliable image color information for any kind of industry. Never get bored."

What you SHOULD KNOW about VaynerMedia
Think “lab” and not “agency”. We get excited about solving business problems, not creating advertising for the sake of making advertising. Our entrepreneurship DNA runs deep. We’re willing to break rules, try new things, and test hypotheses if it means better understanding our craft. It’s fun!
We believe 100% that brands can be built on digital platforms and part of our model is built bottom up, flipping the traditional advertising model and process on its head. We don’t play to agency/industry norms and our culture and energy reflects that.
Our environment (and pace) feels much more like a start-up than most agencies you might be used to. Hopefully that, and the opportunity to collaborate with the talented and enthusiastic crew, work with big brands excites you, as it does us. We can’t wait to meet you.

 Who You Are
 We are looking for someone who loves to ship world-class user interfaces for websites and web apps with solid communication and coding skills. You will be working in a dynamic environment, collaborating with top-notch engineers like yourself to build a solid and scalable architecture for multiple products. :)
 You will likely be a culture fit if you are:
  A builder - Frontend development is full of helpful tools, libraries, and patterns, and you enjoy using these to build products people will love. You like new challenges and strive to ship new features to customers regularly.
A life-long learner - You enjoy keeping up with the latest trends in the frontend space. If a project uses a framework that's new to you, you dive into the docs and tutorials to figure it out.
Have an owner mentality - When bugs appear, you document and fix them. When projects are too complex, you work with others to refine the scope until it's something you believe can be built in a reasonable amount of time and maintained in the long run.
Care about code quality - You believe simple is better and strive to write code that is easy to read and maintain. You consider edge cases and write tests to handle them. When you come across legacy code that is difficult to understand, you add comments or refactor it to make it easier for the next person.
Balancing Act - Great products must balance performance, customer value, code quality, and dependencies. You know how to consider all of these concerns while keeping your focus on shipping things.
The great communicator - If a project is off-track, you bring it up proactively and suggest ways to simplify and get things going. You proactively share status updates without being asked and strive to keep things as honest and transparent as possible."

 At Zenseact we want to make safe and intelligent mobility real, for everyone, everywhere. We develop the complete software stack for ADAS and AD, from pixel to torque. Our focus is to build a single cutting-edge software platform to serve various levels of autonomy and offer unequaled scalability at the same time.

At Zenseact, some five hundred of the best engineering minds globally, stationed across two continents, are collaborating with the same passion: to bring autonomous driving to the streets for real and create a safer journey for everyone. This is part of our culture and how we work, develop and grow together.

Jamf Trust app provides users with secure access to their company resources, an overview of their data usage and information about network threats and currently setup policies for content filtering and mobile internet usage.

That brings many challenges and at the same time is what makes our work interesting and dynamic. Of course, we also do UI work and we are continuously improving the look and feel of our apps so everyone that has a passion for good UX will enjoy it. Writing clean code is part of our philosophy and we use unit tests to back us up when we refactor our codebase. Our project is originally written in Objective-C but we write any new functionality in Swift.

What is a Jamf? You go above and beyond for others, are willing to help, and support the team around you. You value and learn from different perspectives. You are curious and resourceful, a problem-solver, self-driven and constantly improving. You are excited by not knowing what may lie ahead. You are willing to take risks, try new things, even fail just to do it better next time. You’re not a jerk. You are someone who cares about doing the right thing. What does Jamf do? Jamf extends the legendary Apple experience people enjoy in their personal lives to the workplace. We believe the experience of using a device at work or school should feel the same, and be as secure as, using a personal device.

Jamf’s purpose is to simplify work by helping organizations manage and secure an Apple experience that end-users love and organizations trust.

To do this well, they leverage the expertise of our Support Engineering Team, composed of technical subject matter experts on the frontlines of critical customer issues.
 This Support Engineering role skews far more towards engineering than typical technical support as you will need to delve into database internals and memory allocators, diagnose complex SQL query behavior, and investigate Linux and Kubernetes related configurations, all in the name of resolving complex product issues. Our Support Engineers are constantly learning a wide range of customer systems and technical concepts and are thrilled by the new and exciting challenges that they encounter each day.
 To accurately identify the source and solution of an issue, this team will take the time to learn about the customer’s business and systems while helping to improve their fundamental SingleStore and database operational knowledge. This often requires additional research and time spent on learning new technologies and tools outside of just the database engine while also being deeply engaged with multiple departments including development teams, query performance engineering, product management, infrastructure SREs, etc.
   Provide product support to our on-premise and cloud hosted enterprise customers, acting as the first-line-of-defense for complex technical issues, bug diagnosis, or resolving critical outages.
Identify and reproduce product issues and submit formal bug reports or feature requests to the appropriate Engineering team.
Understand and help to improve complex SQL behavior to diagnose bugs or improve performance.
Collaborate with software developers, sales engineers, and technical account managers to keep all teams up to date with current issues a customer may be facing.
Work to streamline and improve various Support and Engineering processes and tools, author new knowledge base articles and run-books, and help the team continually improve efficiency and effectiveness.
Participate in our on-call rotation that may include weekends and holidays.
   4+ years of previous customer-facing advanced technical support experience.
Previous experience as a DBA or Support Engineer at a database company.
Experience with SQL databases and advanced SQL query optimization and tuning. You should be familiar enough with at least one commercial or open source database to decipher its EXPLAIN plan and understand potential performance impact or ways to improve the query.
Strong background in general product troubleshooting, keeping in mind that query processing issues can be impacted by database or linux configuration and resource availability.
A solid linux performance background. That means you are hands-on with Linux and your skills include generating and reading flame graphs, checking system resource utilization, and parsing verbose log files. Bonus points for familiarity with Kubernetes.
Experience with a scripting or coding language. Whether it’s C++, Python, Go, or Bash, you should have a go-to solution for quick problem-solving and be able to navigate through our extensive code base.
Familiarity with distributed systems and AWS/GCP. You understand how organizations deploy and maintain distributed applications and services across multiple machines and know how to analyze these systems for performance bottlenecks.
Experience improving support processes regarding ticket triage, escalation, and reporting business metrics back to the organization.
Strong written and verbal English communication skills. Have the ability to explain technical concepts to a wide range of end-users. 
 SingleStore is one platform for all data, built so you can engage with insight in every moment. Trusted by industry leaders, SingleStore enables enterprises to adapt to change as it happens, embrace diverse data with ease, and accelerate the pace of innovation. SingleStore is venture-backed and headquartered in San Francisco with offices in Portland, Seattle, Boston, Bangalore, London, Lisbon, and Kyiv. Defining the future starts with The Database of Now™.
 Consistent with our commitment to diversity & inclusion, we value individuals with the ability to work on diverse teams and with a diverse range of people.

At Matter Labs, we don’t see ourselves as a company, but as a highly aligned global team on a single mission: to accelerate the mass adoption of crypto for personal sovereignty.
 Our core technology – zkSync – is a layer 2 rollup that uses advanced cryptography called zero-knowledge proofs to scale Ethereum without compromising on security or decentralization. zkSync is EVM compatible, which means projects on Ethereum and other EVM-based blockchains can easily deploy on zkSync to take advantage of low gas fees and high transaction speeds.
 With a total of $458 million in mission-driven funding, zkSync is the first EVM-compatible ZK Rollup to go live on testnet (February 2022) and be deployed on mainnet (October 2022). As we enter the endgame for Ethereum scaling, we are committed to full open source and building in public toward our stated mission [so that even if we fail, the community and the ecosystem will benefit from our contribution].

  Passion. You love what you do, and your enthusiasm never wavers with the specifics of a given task or team. Whether you’re on a plane, train, or sofa, odds are that you’ll be found with your nose in a book or article on the subject.

Accuracy and precision. Your attention to detail is spot-on, and you’re painstakingly accurate.
Logical-analytical abilities. You’re a quick learner who’s able to investigate and effectively pick up new concepts on your own. You can solve unforeseen challenges with creativity and structure, and can do so independently.
Drive. You’re energetic and hard-working, and you persevere through adversity until the job is done—and done impeccably. You’re massively into getting results, and always aim for excellence in what you do.
Curiosity and initiative. You love exploring, and are forever hunting down new opportunities and testing fresh ideas. Rather than waiting to be told what to do, you go seek.

Remote working. Spend as much or as little time in our Milan office as you choose. Many Spooners like to change up their environment and get out of the city whenever the mood strikes. You’ve always got the freedom to decide where today’s office is.
Flexible schedule. Our regular hours are 9-6 GMT+1, but this isn’t a “clock in, clock out” company. You’re fully trusted to create the right conditions for your own personal peak productivity. We only ask that you’re available to your teammates a good chunk of the day (six hours or so). That’s why it’s generally best to be based somewhere with a similar time zone—between GMT-2 and GMT+3.
Competitive salary and stock options. Our compensation package is highly competitive, and can grow rapidly and include stock options, depending on your performance and seniority.
 Fixed-term or internship.
 Milan, Italy or fully remote.
If you choose the on-site option, it’s fine if you prefer to work remotely sometimes. We offer substantial support for relocation, including finding an apartment in Milan and paying the rent for 12 weeks.
 If you successfully pass through our screening process, we’ll invite you to take on a few tests that assess how you approach and solve unfamiliar problems. If you’re successful there, we’ll invite you to take part in some interviews. We welcome applications in English and Italian.

 Summary
About the client/account: Our client is a UK subsidiary of a global financial house working in multiple markets and asset classes. 140+ strong distributed Luxoft team (London/Kyiv/Warsaw) participates in range of client's projects
 About the project"" 11-strong Luxoft based team operates as an extension of the client's Risk IT program and is involved in the development of different components of client's risk platform. The Market Risk IT team is a part of Risk IT and is responsible for designing, integrating and supporting Middle Office Market Risk system in the organization using the third party Markit Financial Risk Analytics (FRA) simulation and pricing engine that provides cross-asset coverage to calculate market risk measures. An in house .NET based application layer integrates the FRA into MUFG proprietary systems.
 The successful candidate will join the Market Risk IT team enhancing this system to meet the requirements of the FRTB IMA project. This is a significant regulatory project with many technical challenges. The existing application is being decoupled into a new 'MRA Service Framework' which will encompass a number of Micro Services. This approach has been chosen to enable the Market Risk system to move to the Cloud and to facilitate segregation of functionality so that services can be developed, tested and released independently. New FRTB IMA functionality will be implemented as Micro Services in the new framework.
 Technologies used: Python, .NET with a large number of vendor solutions for capital markets including Markit FRA, Murex. Microsoft SQL Server as RDBMS. MRS Service Framework is intended to be hosted in Azure cloud.
Opportunities: Rapidly growing team with opportunities for working directly with business users, expanding technical and capital markets knowledge, and developing consultancy / soft skills. The successful candidate would join a highly professional, distributed team.
 Luxoft team operates in WFH mode mainly, office work is possible upon request.
 Responsibilities:
We are looking for a combined C#/python resource as prioritisation can change and there may be periods where C# work is top priority for my team, so we would like to have the option to switch.
 We are looking for someone who also has professional python experience, as we have been doing a fair bit of work in this area in my team. SQL experience is a nice to have rather than mandatory. The python work is heavily concerned with market data (prices, curves, volatility surfaces) so someone with experience in this area would be very beneficial, if you don't have this experience you would need to be willing to learn this (We don't think the person will be successful in this role unless they were willing to understand what the processes we are writing are actually doing)
 Liaise with project team, business analysts and users to gather requirements.
Contribute to the design, development and testing of the Market risk system.
Planning and estimation of all development activities.
Deliver C# .NetCore REST services to implement the MRA Service Framework and FRTM IMA functionality.
Coordinating change control which will include software management, testing and production release.
Provide support and analysis to resolve production issues.

- GIT/Team City.
- Unit and Integration testing.
- Full SDLC experience.

To do this well, they leverage the expertise of our Support Engineering Team, composed of technical subject matter experts on the frontlines of critical customer issues.
 This Support Engineering role skews far more towards engineering than typical technical support as you will need to delve into database internals and memory allocators, diagnose complex SQL query behavior, and investigate Linux and Kubernetes related configurations, all in the name of resolving complex product issues. Our Support Engineers are constantly learning a wide range of customer systems and technical concepts and are thrilled by the new and exciting challenges that they encounter each day.
 To accurately identify the source and solution of an issue, this team will take the time to learn about the customer’s business and systems while helping to improve their fundamental SingleStore and database operational knowledge. This often requires additional research and time spent on learning new technologies and tools outside of just the database engine while also being deeply engaged with multiple departments including development teams, query performance engineering, product management, infrastructure SREs, etc.
   Provide product support to our on-premise and cloud hosted enterprise customers, acting as the first-line-of-defense for complex technical issues, bug diagnosis, or resolving critical outages.
Identify and reproduce product issues and submit formal bug reports or feature requests to the appropriate Engineering team.
Understand and help to improve complex SQL behavior to diagnose bugs or improve performance.
Collaborate with software developers, sales engineers, and technical account managers to keep all teams up to date with current issues a customer may be facing.
Work to streamline and improve various Support and Engineering processes and tools, author new knowledge base articles and run-books, and help the team continually improve efficiency and effectiveness.
Participate in our on-call rotation that may include weekends and holidays.
   4+ years of previous customer-facing advanced technical support experience.
Previous experience as a DBA or Support Engineer at a database company.
Experience with SQL databases and advanced SQL query optimization and tuning. You should be familiar enough with at least one commercial or open source database to decipher its EXPLAIN plan and understand potential performance impact or ways to improve the query.
Strong background in general product troubleshooting, keeping in mind that query processing issues can be impacted by database or linux configuration and resource availability.
A solid linux performance background. That means you are hands-on with Linux and your skills include generating and reading flame graphs, checking system resource utilization, and parsing verbose log files. Bonus points for familiarity with Kubernetes.
Experience with a scripting or coding language. Whether it’s C++, Python, Go, or Bash, you should have a go-to solution for quick problem-solving and be able to navigate through our extensive code base.
Familiarity with distributed systems and AWS/GCP. You understand how organizations deploy and maintain distributed applications and services across multiple machines and know how to analyze these systems for performance bottlenecks.
Experience improving support processes regarding ticket triage, escalation, and reporting business metrics back to the organization.
Strong written and verbal English communication skills. Have the ability to explain technical concepts to a wide range of end-users. 
 SingleStore is one platform for all data, built so you can engage with insight in every moment. Trusted by industry leaders, SingleStore enables enterprises to adapt to change as it happens, embrace diverse data with ease, and accelerate the pace of innovation. SingleStore is venture-backed and headquartered in San Francisco with offices in Portland, Seattle, Boston, Bangalore, London, Lisbon, and Kyiv. Defining the future starts with The Database of Now™.
 Consistent with our commitment to diversity & inclusion, we value individuals with the ability to work on diverse teams and with a diverse range of people.
 To all recruitment agencies: SingleStore does not accept agency resumes. Please do not forward resumes to SingleStore employees. SingleStore is not responsible for any fees related to unsolicited resumes and will not pay fees to any third-party agency or company that does not have a signed agreement with the Company.

 This is an opportunity to make an impact at the intersection of two of the most transformative technologies of this decade – 5G and AI/ML. VMware is looking for a highly motivated software engineer to join its product R&D team that is developing a data-driven intelligent controller platform for 5G mobile networks worldwide.
 In this role, you will develop data pipeline services for handling large-scale network telemetry data from a variety of 5G network sources. Depending on the type of data, these services may be handling hundreds of thousands to millions of events per second via a cloud-based distributed architecture, and processing tens to hundreds of GBs per second of data across thousands of nodes. You will also develop APIs to expose these services to 3rd-party developers and work with a large ecosystem of VMware commercial partners (and VMware internal developers) who will use your APIs to develop their respective AI/ML-based applications. You will work closely with fellow platform engineers, operations engineers, UI/UX engineers, product managers, SREs and other cross-functional teams to deliver carrier-grade software products to 5G service providers around the globe. In the process, you will collaborate closely with experts in the fields of cloud, AI/ML and 5G, and work in an environment that provides ample learning and career growth opportunities.
 What are the performance outcomes over the first 6-12 months you will work toward completing? 
 As a key member of the R&D team, you will develop and test data pipeline services that ingest large volumes of data, process them efficiently, and expose them via APIs to AI/ML applications.
  Within 30 days of joining, you will be expected to get familiar with the product architecture and high-level design of the product components. You will be expected to deliver a few simple bug fixes or small features to gain familiarity with the development process.

Within 360 days, you will be the owner of at least one major data pipeline service, and you would have driven it all the way from design to delivery as part of a commercial release of the product. 
  What type of work will you be doing? What assignments, requirements, or skills will you be performing on a regular basis? 
 Your assignments may be modified to suit your professional strengths, but you can expect a variety of the following:
  Understand product requirements for one or more data pipeline services, contribute to functional specifications and collaborate with fellow engineers to transform them into software designs. To do so, you will require good conceptual understanding of distributed systems, data pipelines and cloud-native design. 
Develop features for data pipeline services that handle large volumes of data using a cloud-based distributed architecture. In doing so, you will use your experience with programming in Go and/or Java. You will also require familiarity with technologies for messaging and APIs like Kafka, REST/JSON, gRPC/protobuf, and cloud technologies like Kubernetes and Docker. 
Implement unit tests and functional tests to ensure the features you develop meet their quality requirements. You will leverage your experience with defining tests and automating them using Python-based frameworks or otherwise. 
Iterate on features to meet non-functional requirements related to scalability, monitoring, troubleshooting, etc. 
Collaborate with cross-functional teams including QA, UI/UX, etc. to ensure that your features/services make it all the way into commercial releases of our products. 
 What is the leadership like for this role? What is the structure and culture of the team like?
 The hiring manager for this role is Rakesh Misra.

În 2020, am ajuns pe lista Deloitte Fast 500 EMEA a companiilor cu cea mai rapidă creștere, iar în 2022 am primit pentru a treia oară premiul „Lovable Workplace”.
Astăzi, peste 2000 de companii folosesc zilnic produsul nostru, iar echipa noastră este formată din peste 90 de membri. Misiunea noastră este să facem produse inovatoare, bine concepute, care să permită companiilor să deservească mai mulți clienți. Valorile noastre de bază sunt următoarele: îmbunătățirea constantă, onestitate, deschiderea, conștientizarea de sine, corectitudinea.
 Ești focusat pe atingerea obiectivelor de vânzări și cauți constant modalități de a fi și mai eficient? Continuă-ți cariera alături de o echipă motivată!
 Avem o poziție pentru tine dacă te poți identifica cu următoarele:
Comunici bine? Îți place să gestionezi conversațiile?
Ai deja experiență de minim 1 an în vânzări și ești interesat de dezvoltare în acest domeniu?
Ai dori să discuți cu directorii de afaceri, antreprenori și să le afli problemele și nevoile de afaceri?
Gestionezi calculatorul la nivel avansat? Nu ai probleme în a lucra cu Google Office Apps? Ți-ar plăcea să înveți și tu să lucrezi în MiniCRM?
Îți place să vânezi recorduri și ești mânat de spiritul competiției? Nu interpretezi recordurile stabilite ca o limitare, ci ca rezultate care trebuie obținute?
Ești mânat de numere? Ești concentrat pe atingerea obiectivelor tale de vânzări și cauți constant modalități de a fi și mai eficient?
Ești persistent și orientat către rezultate? Nu renunți la primul obstacol și poți lucra pe cont propriu pentru a-ți atinge scopul?
Ești perseverent și plin de resurse? Rezultatele și dorința de cunoaștere te conduc?
Ai o atitudine pozitivă și ai încredere în tine? O persoană care crede în sine, în abilitățile sale și în produsul pe care îl reprezintă? Asta nu este o problemă, nu-i așa?
Ai cunoștințe de limba engleză la nivel mediu spre avansat! (Pentru comunicarea cu clienții se utilizează limba română, însă pentru comunicarea în cadrul companiei folosim și limba engleză)
  Care vor fi sarcinile tale? 
Ca și parte a procesului de Onboarding vei avea posibilitatea să cunoști în întregime procesul nostru de vânzări, vei face cunoștință și cu colegii din echipa de Asistent vânzări/Sales Support, unde vei vedea cum:
Contactăm telefonic clienții interesați (manageri de companii, antreprenori) pentru evaluarea nevoilor acestora.
Concluzionăm pe baza discuției avute dacă soluția noastră poate să le rezolve problemele, nevoile, și să eficientizeze procesele lor.
Programăm mai departe la o ședință de consultanță cu un coleg din echipa de Vânzări.
Gestionăm atât leadurile cât și sarcinile zilnice într-un sistem unificat și accesibil de CRM, care ne ajută și să ne monitorizăm progresul zilnic.
Colaborăm cu alte echipe, în special cu echipa de Vânzări, căreia colegii le oferă suport și cu care se sincronizează legat de targete.
  După care, focusul tău va fi pe partea de Vânzări, unde vei:
Fii busola procesului nostru de vânzări, vei ajuta managerii de afaceri de succes, antreprenorii, să ia o decizie responsabilă cu privire la implementarea MiniCRM.
Identifica nevoile și provocările de afaceri, prin utilizarea diverselor metodologii și tehnici de chestionare.
Oferi consultanță înainte de vânzare. În urma descoperirii problemelor și nevoilor de afaceri, vei folosi partajarea online a ecranului pentru a prezenta soluția în MiniCRM care va ajuta clienții să devină mai productivi, de succes și remarcabili pe piață.
Face partea de administrare. Coșmarul oricărui vânzător. Vești bune însă: nu vei folosi o grămadă de hârtii sau post-it-uri, nici foi Excel. Folosim o soluție unică și ușor de accesat de gestionare a relațiilor cu clienții care se numește MiniCRM. :)
Colabora eficient cu alte echipe. Vânzările joacă un rol central în organizație, deci sunt strâns legate de mai multe echipe. De aceea, va fi extrem de important să avem o relație bună cu echipa de Account Management (căreia îi transferăm clienții importanți pentru a ajuta la implementarea sistemului), echipa de Sales Support (care ne califică mai întâi clienții și îi transmit spre vânzare) și echipa de Marketing (care se așteaptă ca feedback-ul nostru valoros să fie încorporat în reclamele și campaniile noastre).
Contribui prin rezultatele tale la îndeplinirea obiectivelor de echipă.
  Ce îți oferim?
Venit mediu lunar: 7150 - 8200 RON brut/lună, compus din: parte fixă+ bonusuri lunare bazate pe performanță (comisionul nu este plafonat, așa că poți câștiga mai mult decât intervalul menționat mai sus, încă din perioada de probă!)
Asigurare de sănătate privată
Onboarding complet și oportunități de formare
Zile suplimentare de vacanță în funcție de politica noastră internă
Dispozitive de calitate (Macbook, smartphone)
Oportunitate de a lucra de acasă

  La ce te poți aștepta de la MiniCRM?
Succesul nu este o chestiune de noroc, așa că acordăm o atenție deosebită dezvoltării profesionale și personale.
Recunoaștem și sărbătorim rezultatele și performanța remarcabilă. Pentru acestea deschidem deseori și șampania. ;)
Ne pasă de părerea ta. Apreciem ideile și inițiativele, iar echipa noastră de resurse umane se ocupă de feedback-ul colegilor săptămânal de săptămână. Ne vom ocupa și de feedback-ul tău.
Acordăm atenție echilibrului dintre viața profesională și viața privată, suntem flexibili dacă ai o sarcină administrativă importantă, și nu există niciun dezavantaj dacă ai copii.

For this position, we are looking for someone with a solid background in mathematics and basic programming experience. Additionally, topics such as AI, frontend and backend development, IT security, and mobile app development are part of our core curriculum so experience with this is a plus.At CODE, lecturers do not see themselves as the main resource for valuable knowledge that needs to be passed on to students through PowerPoint-driven lectures. Instead, we are always keen to provide our students with challenges that trigger their intrinsic learning impulses. To give you the best possible understanding of the role, here are some activities which you will be responsible for: 
Teaching Mathematics and Programming by supporting the overall project-based learning approach (rather than in the format of lectures) with students from varied international backgrounds and ability levels
Mentoring students to support their experience in a self-directed environment

Creating an inclusive environment so that students not always represented in the tech world feel supported and secure at CODE

You have a high proficiency in English so you can easily communicate with our international community.
You have a solid understanding of Mathematics (Multivariable Calculus, Linear Algebra, Set and Graph Theory), and basic programming so that you can teach, assess, and provide office hour support to students.
You have general knowledge and practical experience with Software Engineering so that you can support students in their project work.
You have great communication skills so that you can provide an engaging and welcoming learning environment particularly for students in their first year.

Having a German bank account to be able to get paid
The right to work and primary residence in Germany
Ability to work in person in Berlin

Knowledge in any of the following topics for the possibility of supporting other Software Engineering lecturers: databases, AI, frontend development, backend development, distributed and parallel computing, IT security, embedded computing, operating systems, mobile app development, control engineering, or collaboration in software engineering teams.
You have mentoring and project consulting experience so that you are comfortable with one-on-one guidance and support.
You have teaching, training, or presentation experience so that you can bring best practices to the learning environment.
Experience working with a wide range of international backgrounds in order to support different learning and cultural backgrounds
German language skills to support with academic translations and university partners

The investment was led by Goldman Sachs Asset Management with participation from Bain Capital Ventures and Sixth Street Growth. For more information, visit Bloomreach.com. We are currently expanding our Application Platform team and we are looking for Backend Software Engineer. Is ""security"", ""curiosity"" or ""growth"" your middle name? Then you are a good fit and you can be one of us. You can work remotely or from one of our local offices. The salary starts at €3,000 based on your experience level. About your role and the team: The Application Platform team empowers other engineering teams to build their services effectively and with security and compliance built-in by designing, implementing, and maintaining the magic solid foundations and the core frameworks of the Bloomreach Engagement. Examples of the initiatives driven by this team are: 
Integrated zero-trust authentication and authorization management system.
Platform for collecting and processing audit logs in a distributed environment.
Notification center, which allows other teams to communicate information to customers through a single unified channel (upcoming project). 
What you might like about this role: 
Wide reach - we deal with teams across the company - product, security, architects, engineers, even customers.
Security perspective will be a key element of your day-to-day work
Developing Cloud Native services consumed by customers as well as other engineering teams 
What your typical day might look like: You start your day with a code review of your colleague’s tasks while sipping a cup of fresh-brewed tea or coffee, looking for any signs of problems and possible optimizations. Then you join your teammates on a quick daily standup, where you discuss what you’re currently working on and the plan for the next few days. After the meeting, you get into “the zone” and spend a few undisturbed hours working on the new authentication framework while making sure it’s safely covered by a suite of unit tests. With a few clicks you quickly spin up a brand new instance of the system in the development cluster, deploy your change and notify the frontend engineer that it’s ready. You grab a snack and take a little break from coding. Instead, you help a fellow backend engineer from another team figure out the best way to integrate their new service with the audit logging platform. In the meantime the frontend engineer gets back to you and confirms that all the new endpoints work as expected, so you create a merge request and ask your teammates for a code review. It’s a complex piece of code, so you go through it together. After your code is approved, you merge it, automatically deploying it to the staging environment where it receives further testing by the QA team and automated integration tests before being released to production. You end your day in a short meeting with a product manager and the director of engineering, where you flesh out the idea you had over lunch yesterday for a new approach to release management that would make the whole process even faster. Our tech stack: 
Python & Go
MongoDB, Redis, Apache Kafka
Kubernetes (GKE)
Various Google Cloud Platform services (Pub/Sub, BigTable, DataFlow, ...)
Gitlab CI/CD, Prometheus and Grafana

Experience with database systems of different kinds (MongoDB, Redis, Apache Kafka)

It offers a suite of products that drive true personalization and digital commerce growth, including: 
Discovery, offering AI-driven search and merchandising 
Content, offering a headless CMS

Together, these solutions combine the power of unified customer and product data with the speed and scale of AI-optimization, enabling revenue-driving digital commerce experiences that convert on any channel and every journey. Bloomreach serves over 850 global brands including Albertsons, Bosch, Puma, FC Bayern München, and Marks & Spencer. Bloomreach recently raised $175 million in a Series F funding round, bringing its total valuation to $2.2 billion. The investment was led by Goldman Sachs Asset Management with participation from Bain Capital Ventures and Sixth Street Growth. For more information, visit Bloomreach.com. We are currently expanding our Application Platform team and we are looking for Backend Software Engineer. Is ""security"", ""curiosity"" or ""growth"" your middle name? Then you are a good fit and you can be one of us. You can work remotely or from one of our local offices. The salary starts at €3,000 based on your experience level. About your role and the team: The Application Platform team empowers other engineering teams to build their services effectively and with security and compliance built-in by designing, implementing, and maintaining the magic solid foundations and the core frameworks of the Bloomreach Engagement. Examples of the initiatives driven by this team are: 
Integrated zero-trust authentication and authorization management system.
Platform for collecting and processing audit logs in a distributed environment.
Notification center, which allows other teams to communicate information to customers through a single unified channel (upcoming project). 
What you might like about this role: 
Wide reach - we deal with teams across the company - product, security, architects, engineers, even customers.
Security perspective will be a key element of your day-to-day work
Developing Cloud Native services consumed by customers as well as other engineering teams 
What your typical day might look like: You start your day with a code review of your colleague’s tasks while sipping a cup of fresh-brewed tea or coffee, looking for any signs of problems and possible optimizations. Then you join your teammates on a quick daily standup, where you discuss what you’re currently working on and the plan for the next few days. After the meeting, you get into “the zone” and spend a few undisturbed hours working on the new authentication framework while making sure it’s safely covered by a suite of unit tests. With a few clicks you quickly spin up a brand new instance of the system in the development cluster, deploy your change and notify the frontend engineer that it’s ready. You grab a snack and take a little break from coding. Instead, you help a fellow backend engineer from another team figure out the best way to integrate their new service with the audit logging platform. In the meantime the frontend engineer gets back to you and confirms that all the new endpoints work as expected, so you create a merge request and ask your teammates for a code review. It’s a complex piece of code, so you go through it together. After your code is approved, you merge it, automatically deploying it to the staging environment where it receives further testing by the QA team and automated integration tests before being released to production. You end your day in a short meeting with a product manager and the director of engineering, where you flesh out the idea you had over lunch yesterday for a new approach to release management that would make the whole process even faster. Our tech stack: 
Python & Go
MongoDB, Redis, Apache Kafka
Kubernetes (GKE)
Various Google Cloud Platform services (Pub/Sub, BigTable, DataFlow, ...)
Gitlab CI/CD, Prometheus and Grafana 
What we expect of the candidate: The ideal candidate has: 
At least 3 year experience developing in Python or Golang
Designing and implementing production-grade REST APIs 
Having experience with operating services in production is beneficial
A working understanding of fundamental web security principles (OWASP), Authentication and Authorization practices
Experience with database systems of different kinds (MongoDB, Redis, Apache Kafka) 
Regional benefits: 
Monthly lunch entitlement by up to 110€ per month
Pension scheme or Health insurance depending on region

It offers a suite of products that drive true personalization and digital commerce growth, including: 
Discovery, offering AI-driven search and merchandising 
Content, offering a headless CMS 
Engagement, offering a leading CDP and marketing automation solutions 
Together, these solutions combine the power of unified customer and product data with the speed and scale of AI-optimization, enabling revenue-driving digital commerce experiences that convert on any channel and every journey. Bloomreach serves over 850 global brands including Albertsons, Bosch, Puma, FC Bayern München, and Marks & Spencer. Bloomreach recently raised $175 million in a Series F funding round, bringing its total valuation to $2.2 billion. The investment was led by Goldman Sachs Asset Management with participation from Bain Capital Ventures and Sixth Street Growth. For more information, visit Bloomreach.com. We are currently expanding our Application Platform team and we are looking for Backend Software Engineer. Is ""security"", ""curiosity"" or ""growth"" your middle name? Then you are a good fit and you can be one of us. You can work remotely or from one of our local offices. The salary starts at €3,000 based on your experience level. About your role and the team: The Application Platform team empowers other engineering teams to build their services effectively and with security and compliance built-in by designing, implementing, and maintaining the magic solid foundations and the core frameworks of the Bloomreach Engagement. Examples of the initiatives driven by this team are: 
Integrated zero-trust authentication and authorization management system.
Platform for collecting and processing audit logs in a distributed environment.
Notification center, which allows other teams to communicate information to customers through a single unified channel (upcoming project). 
What you might like about this role: 
Wide reach - we deal with teams across the company - product, security, architects, engineers, even customers.
Security perspective will be a key element of your day-to-day work
Developing Cloud Native services consumed by customers as well as other engineering teams 
What your typical day might look like: You start your day with a code review of your colleague’s tasks while sipping a cup of fresh-brewed tea or coffee, looking for any signs of problems and possible optimizations. Then you join your teammates on a quick daily standup, where you discuss what you’re currently working on and the plan for the next few days. After the meeting, you get into “the zone” and spend a few undisturbed hours working on the new authentication framework while making sure it’s safely covered by a suite of unit tests. With a few clicks you quickly spin up a brand new instance of the system in the development cluster, deploy your change and notify the frontend engineer that it’s ready. You grab a snack and take a little break from coding. Instead, you help a fellow backend engineer from another team figure out the best way to integrate their new service with the audit logging platform. In the meantime the frontend engineer gets back to you and confirms that all the new endpoints work as expected, so you create a merge request and ask your teammates for a code review. It’s a complex piece of code, so you go through it together. After your code is approved, you merge it, automatically deploying it to the staging environment where it receives further testing by the QA team and automated integration tests before being released to production. You end your day in a short meeting with a product manager and the director of engineering, where you flesh out the idea you had over lunch yesterday for a new approach to release management that would make the whole process even faster. Our tech stack: 
Python & Go
MongoDB, Redis, Apache Kafka
Kubernetes (GKE)
Various Google Cloud Platform services (Pub/Sub, BigTable, DataFlow, ...)
Gitlab CI/CD, Prometheus and Grafana 
What we expect of the candidate: The ideal candidate has: 
At least 3 year experience developing in Python or Golang
Designing and implementing production-grade REST APIs 
Having experience with operating services in production is beneficial
A working understanding of fundamental web security principles (OWASP), Authentication and Authorization practices
Experience with database systems of different kinds (MongoDB, Redis, Apache Kafka) 
Regional benefits: 
Monthly lunch entitlement by up to 110€ per month
Pension scheme or Health insurance depending on region 
More things you'll like about Bloomreach: Culture:

 What type of work will I be doing? What assignments will I be performing on a regular basis? 
 Typical assignments for your position will be:
  Research how to configure and deploy PostgreSQL, and in the future other databases, to achieve the outcomes above.

DMP is dé bekendste datamanagement specialist in Nederland, maar ook wereldwijd is DMP hard op weg naar een opmars. Met ruim 90 specialisten verdeeld over vestigingen in Nederland, Duitsland, Spanje en Zuid- Afrika, bedienen wij ruim 350 klanten over de hele wereld met betrouwbare en kosteneffectieve datamanagement oplossingen.
 Sinds 2020 is DMP overgenomen door Broad Horizon groep, aanbieder van IT-, data- en cloudoplossingen. Met deze overname groeit DMP (internationaal) nog sneller. Groei jij met ons mee?
 Dit zijn wij
DMP-ers zijn gedreven, gezellige en zeer vakkundige collega’s. Wij werken elke dag met plezier aan het leveren van onze expertise aan de klanten, zowel zelfstandig als in teamverband.
 Wij zijn altijd op zoek naar initiatiefrijke nieuwe collega's, vakkundige teamspelers die passie hebben voor het werkgebied waarin wij ons in bevinden. Mensen met ambitie die graag willen groeien en willen blijven ontwikkelen. Die lef hebben en zelf de eerste stap durven te zetten.
 Dit ben jij
Je wil voor elk probleem een oplossing vinden! Sterker nog, jij ziet kansen waar anderen problemen zien. Je vindt het prettig om anderen te kunnen helpen en wil er tegelijkertijd voor zorgen dat problemen zo min mogelijk voorvallen. Je bent klantvriendelijk en servicegericht, zelfs als je met je verkeerde been uit bed bent gestapt (en laten we eerlijk zijn, dat gebeurt ons allemaal wel eens).
 Ook al los je het probleem misschien niet direct op, je vindt het belangrijk de klant tijdig en volledig te informeren over de status van een ticket. Je weet hoe belangrijk een klant dit vindt!
 Zo ziet je dag eruit
Je stapt uit je bed, gaat naar kantoor of gaat thuis achter je pc zitten, waar je, na een kop koffie of thee, de lopende zaken met het team bespreekt.
 Na deze call ga je aan de slag met een openstaande supportticket t.b.v. van onze back-up oplossing. Het is een ingewikkeld probleem waar je even flink je tanden in kan zetten. Je duikt in logs en jouw beste troubleshooting skills komen naar boven. Informatie haal je uit eerdere ervaringen of documentatie van de leverancier. Na een tijdje puzzelen heb je het probleem gevonden en los je het ticket op. Heerlijk, weer een ticket minder!
 Op naar naar het volgende ticket. Dit is weer een heel ander probleem maar waarin jouw kennis nog niet toereikend is. Gelukkig kunnen jouw directe collega’s op de afdeling support jou helpen of vind je iemand anders binnen het bedrijf. Jij kent immers iedereen en zij kennen jou. Misschien niet meteen, maar wel wat later.
 Bij het derde ticket weten jij en je collega’s het ook niet en ga je naar de leverancier. Jouw onderzoek is van zo’n kwaliteit dat hun supportafdeling jouw onderzoek alleen kan bevestigen en je ticket moet doorzetten naar de ontwikkelaars. Daar blijkt dat er een bug zit in het product, kudo’s voor jou. Nu is het nog zaak om de boel scherp te houden en de klant te informeren.
Ondertussen belt een klant. Het zijn er niet veel op een dag, maar om een probleem op te lossen moeten we er eerst één krijgen!
 Dit keer is het een vraag welke jij direct kunt beantwoorden. Nog even registreren en klaar. Nu is het tijd voor wat fris en misschien een spelletje te spelen met een collega.
 Werk je vandaag thuis? Dan zorg je tussendoor natuurlijk dat je af en toe even je benen strekt en je ogen van het beeldscherm haalt (we kennen onze mensen: voor je het weten zitten ze 24/7 achter het beeldscherm)! Eet je boterhammetje bijvoorbeeld even tijdens een wandelingetje..
 Ben je op kantoor, dan schuif je gezellig met collega’s aan in onze gezellige bedrijfskantine waar een heerlijk huisgemaakte lunch wordt bereid. Elke dag weer anders.
 In de middag ga je met je collega kijken naar het ticket waar je eerder niet uitkwam. Samen lossen jullie het op. En weer een ticket minder! Jammer dat er net weer een klant belde met een ander probleem. Of toch niet ;-)
 Er is alweer een einde gekomen aan deze zeer dynamische en afwisselend dag. Je kijkt nog even wat je op de agenda hebt voor morgen, sluit af en of je nu gaat sporten, een filmpje kijken of een drankje doen met vriend/vriendin: je probeert vooral even niet aan werk te denken!
 Morgen ben je vrij gepland, dan heb je tijd voor die zaken waar je even geen tijd voor had of kun je eindelijk die training doen die je de hele tijd al op je lijstje had staan.
 Werkzaamheden:
In deze functie is het telefonisch aannemen en registreren van tickets marginaal! Je bent 90% van je tijd bezig met oplossen/troubleshooten van incidenten.
Het registreren en oplossen van supporttickets van onze klanten, tbv back-up oplossing en storage van o.a. Commvault oplossingen. Gartner Magic Quadrant: Commvault Is A Leader For The 10th Time
Naast Commvault verkopen en supporten wij ook producten van Netapp, Komprise en Cohesity. Hierin willen wij ons ontwikkelen als begin-en eindstation voor een klant zoals wij dat ook zijn voor Commvault. Je krijgt de kans je hierin verder te ontwikkelen samen met je collega’s!
Het ondersteunen en begeleiden van jouw collega's op technisch vlak.
Aanspreekpartner zijn voor onze klanten om datamanagementvraagstukken op te lossen en hen op diverse andere gebieden te ondersteunen.
Adviseren, begeleiden en ondersteunen van onze klanten bij problemen met back-up, archivering, contentindexering en opslag.
Contact leggen met verschillende leveranciers om problemen te escaleren als het gaat om bugs in de producten.
Klanten adviseren over installatie, configuratie en optimalisatie.
 Je back-up wordt wel eens je beste monitoring tool genoemd. Zit er iets fout in het netwerk, draait een applicatie niet dan zie je dit meestal terug in het falen van een back-up. Je kennis gaat dus verder dan alleen de back-up applicatie.
 Waarom dit (n)iets voor jou is:
+ Je bent analytisch sterk;
+ Je hebt MBO/HBO werk – en denkniveau. Je hebt passie voor servicegerichtheid, beheer en een proactieve klantvriendelijke houding;
+ Goede beheersing van de Nederlandse en Engelse taal;
+ Je hebt kennis van Microsoft-applicaties;
+ Je hebt ervaring met Back-up oplossingen;
+ Je hebt ervaring met Commvault (pre).
 Ben je nog niet ervaren in deze rol, maar klinkt het wel heel erg leuk en zou je dit prachtige vak willen leren? Neem dan ook contact met ons op: er is bij ons ook plek om dit vak te leren onder begeleiding van ervaren support engineers! 
 Wij zijn natuurlijk ontzettend blij met jou als nieuwe collega!
Naast een uitdagende functie op unieke locaties bieden wij jou daarom een salaris dat aansluit bij wat jouw collega’s in de branche verdienen en hebben we goede secundaire voorwaarden zoals:
Uitstekend pakket in lijn met jouw ervaringsniveau;
Mogelijkheden om te groeien (certificering, training, webinars en kennisdeel sessies), omdat we jouw potentieel net zo waardevol vinden als jouw huidige vaardigheden;
1 op 1 begeleiding in de vorm van een buddy;
Een laptop en telefoon van de zaak;
Hybride werkmogelijkheden;
Diverse nevenactiviteiten binnen DMP (bootcamp, sociale projecten, incentives);
 Als je bij ons komt werken, dan kom je terecht in een professioneel team dat van resultaten houdt. De sfeer is informeel en de lijnen zijn kort. Jouw groei vinden wij belangrijk en hier krijg je ook alle ruimte en tools voor om jouw groei te stimuleren! Wil jij meer weten over deze uitdagende functie of DMP? Neem dan contact op met Bart Uittenhout via buittenhout@dm-p.com of telefonisch op 06 510 44 898."
